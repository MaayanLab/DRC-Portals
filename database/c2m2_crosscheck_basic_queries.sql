/* Some basic queries to check if metadata from various DCCs, together in the schema c2m2

1. Check if counts from respective schema match with count from c2m2 schema for tables which have 
id_namespace and local_id columns.
Do not do this for ontology/term tables such as protein.tsv, compound.tsv, etc., since there, 
several DCCs will have overlapiing terms.

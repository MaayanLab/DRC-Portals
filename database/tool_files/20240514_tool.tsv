08cd40cc-f35f-547f-a8d7-524859559b0c	Playbook Workflow Builder	The Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) Playbook Workflow Builder (PWB) is a web-based platform that facilitates knowledge resolution by enabling users to traverse an ever-growing network of input datasets, semantically annotated API endpoints, and data visualization tools contributed by the ecosystem. Via a user-friendly web-based user-interface, workflows can be constructed from these building-blocks without technical expertise. The output of these workflows is provided as reports containing textual descriptions, interactive figures, and downloadable tables.	https://playbook-workflow-builder.cloud/	/img/pwb.png	Web-based platform to construct biomedical workflows	/img/pwb-screenshot.png	True
3569c3de-97e3-5822-a895-d6c7d28da983	GDLPA	Gene and Drug Landing Page Aggregator (GDLPA) has links to 53 gene, 18 variant and 19 drug repositories that provide direct links to gene and drug landing pages. You can search by gene or drug name and then choose the sites that contain knowledge about your gene or drug of interest. Resources supported by the NIH Common Fund are listed first and have the CFDE logo at their top right corner.	https://cfde-gene-pages.cloud/	/img/gdlpa.png	Query 53 gene-centric, 18 variant-centric, and 19 drug-centric repositories	/img/gdlpa-screenshot.png	
4b13395c-45b7-5911-b255-527934471945	FAIRshake	The FAIRshake toolkit was developed to enable the establishment of community-driven FAIR metrics and rubrics paired with manual and automated FAIR assessments. FAIR assessments are visualized as an insignia that can be embedded within digital-resources-hosting websites. Using FAIRshake, a variety of biomedical digital resources were manually and automatically evaluated for their level of FAIRness.	https://fairshake.cloud/	/img/fairshake.png	Toolkit to evaluate the FAIRness of research digital resources	/img/fairshake-screenshot.png	
33ccfdb7-b5eb-5fca-9fb6-208b7b72099d	ReproTox-KG	To further characterize associations between small molecule compounds and their potential to induce specific birth abnormalities, we gathered knowledge from multiple sources to construct a reproductive toxicity Knowledge Graph (ReproTox-KG) with a focus on associations between birth defects, drugs, and genes.	https://maayanlab.cloud/reprotox-kg	/img/reprotox-kg-logo.png	Toxicology knowledge graph for structural birth defects	/img/reprotox-kg-screenshot.png	True
b08fa45b-a979-509a-a3a5-de9616bec4e1	Data Distillery Knowledge Graph	The Unified Biomedical Knowledge Graph (UBKG) is a knowledge graph database that represents a set of interrelated concepts from biomedical ontologies and vocabularies. The UBKG combines information from the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) with assertions from “non-UMLS” ontologies or vocabularies.	https://dd-kg-ui.cfde.cloud/	/img/ubkg.png	KG database represents interrelated biomedical ontologies and vocabularies	/img/ubkg-screenshot.png	
dcb54e80-a288-54df-9283-be888901784f	Standard RNA-seq Processing Pipelines	The CFDE RNA-seq Pipeline Harmonization partnership is a collaboration between multiple DCCs (GTEx, UDN, KF, HuBMAP, SPARC, MoTrPAC) to update their RNA-seq pipelines across the DCCs with a revised version of the STAR RNA-seq aligner.  The goal is to enable uniform alignment to a diploid reference genome, and thus improving detection of variant effects, e.g., rare-splicing-variants, and a common GENCODE reference, by reprocessing all the existing accessible bulk-tissue RNA-seq reference resources. The partnership also aime to assess harmonization of single cell RNA-seq data, by running similar HuBMAP, GTEx, Kids First and SPARC single-cell RNA-seq datasets through the current HuBMAP scRNA-seq pipeline with a goal to evaluate results and generate recommendations for improvements.	https://github.com/hubmapconsortium/salmon-rnaseq		Revised STAR RNA-seq aligner to update RNA-seq pipelines across CF programs		True

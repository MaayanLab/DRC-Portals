ingest/c2m2s/HMP/datapackage/merged/data/project.tsv:tag:hmpdacc.org,2022-04-04:	HHS			HHS	Healthy Human Subjects	The Healthy Human Subjects project is part of phase 1 of the Human Micrbiome Project and involved characterization of the normal microbiota from 300 healthy adults. It entailed sampling from 18 body sites in women and 15 in men (excluding three vaginal sites) distributed among five major body areas. The samples were subjected to 454 pyrosequencing for 16S rRNA gene analysis to characterize the complexity of microbial communities. For a subset of the samples, Illumina whole metagenome sequencing was done for taxonomic profiling, metabolic profiling, gene finding, and gene annotation. Numerous additional analyses were performed on the data.

The project followed 1,527 women longitudinally through pregnancy and involved the collection of 206,437 samples, including maternal vaginal, buccal, rectal, skin and nares swabs, blood, urine, and birth products, as well as infant cord and cord blood, meconium and first stool, buccal, skin and rectal swabs. Subsets of these specimens underwent 16S rRNA gene taxonomic analysis, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing, cytokine profiling, lipidomics analysis, and bacterial genome analysis.

We compared four platforms for these characteristics: small RNA-seq, FirePlex, EdgeSeq, and nCounter. Using a pool of synthetic miRNAs, coefficients of variation for technical replicates for EdgeSeq (6.9%) and RNA-seq (8.2%) were lower than FirePlex (22.4%); nCounter replicates were not performed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis for distinguishing present versus absent miRNAs showed small RNA-seq (area under curve 0.99) was superior to EdgeSeq (0.97), nCounter (0.94), and FirePlex (0.81). Expected differences in expression of placenta-associated miRNAs in plasma from pregnant and non-pregnant women were observed with RNA-seq and EdgeSeq, but not FirePlex or nCounter. These results indicate that differences in performance among miRNA profiling platforms impact ability to detect biological differences among samples, and thus their relative utility for research and clinical use.

In the past 100 years, dietary patterns in Western societies have changed remarkably. The consumption of saturated fatty acids (SFA), omega-6 (n-6) unsaturated fatty acids and refined carbohydrates has risen sharply, whereas consumption of fruits, vegetables and omega-3 fatty acids (n-3) has declined. This dietary pattern is associated with post-prandial oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which are implicated in numerous disease processes. The key rationale for this pilot grant application stems from studies reporting a decline in reproductive function in women that is coincident with changing patterns of Western diet, observations of Western diet-associated infertility in rodents, and adverse effects of diet on ovarian reserve in monkeys. Recently, ovarian-metabolomic profiling has been used to characterize oxidative and inflammatory pathways in the non-diseased ovary. Using this technology, it has also been reported that aging women, and those with reduced ovarian reserve, have altered follicular fluid levels of carbohydrates and reproductive hormones compared to normal ovarian reserve women. Therefore, this methodology is ideal for determining differences in global metabolomic profiles among ovaries derived from subjects of differing nutritional backgrounds. The proposed study will compare the effects of chronic exposure to a typical Western diet with a prudent diet on ovarian metabolome and metabolites associated with oxidative stress pathways. The central hypothesis is that ovaries from monkeys exposed to markedly divergent nutritional backgrounds will differentiate from each other with respect to their metabolome and with respect to metabolites indicative of oxidative stress. We will address this with three Specific Aims designed to: 1) determine whether the metabolome of ovarian tissue from cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) differentiates by nutritional background; 2) determine if metabolomic profiles of ovarian tissue will differentiate by age in pedigreed, known-age domestic vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) and 3) investigate whether the effects of diet or age on ovarian tissue metabolome is reflected by changes in serum metabolites. Archived ovarian tissue from two well-established nonhuman primate models of women?s health (Macaca fascicularis and Chlorocebus aethiops sabaeus) will be used for this study.

Despite global warnings and awareness of the detrimental effects of smoking on health, smoking-derived nicotine dependence makes it very difficult to relinquish the habit. Unfortunately, nicotine exposure makes females more susceptible to ischemic neurodegeneration. Moreover, this susceptibility is enhanced when combined with oral contraceptives. Usually, women initiate nicotine usage during their adolescence, the period of life when one also is likely to get sexually active and also likely to use oral contraceptives. The underlying mechanisms responsible for the exacerbated neurodegeneration due to the long exposure of nicotine and oral contraceptives are not known. Our published studies showed that nicotine toxicity is exacerbated by oral contraceptives via altered mitochondrial function and increased reactive oxygen species production in the hippocampus of female rats. This mitochondrial dysfunction involved a defect on the enzymatic activity of the terminal enzyme of the electron transport chain (complex IV) as a consequence of an impaired biogenesis. However, how this mitochondrial impairment impacts the overall brain metabolism remains to be investigated. To understand the overall effect of nicotine on the brain metabolism and the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced toxicity of nicotine when combined with oral contraceptives, we propose two specific aims. We will investigate the metabolomic profile of brains (hippocampus) of female rats treated with nicotine alone or in combination with oral contraceptives. We will also determine the effect on the activity and steady-state levels of key regulatory metabolic enzymes. We will use an established rat animal model mimicking conditions of nicotine exposure produced by cigarette smoking and simulating conditions of oral contraceptives usage taking in consideration hormonal cycles in women. Discerning the exact effects of nicotine and its combination with oral contraceptives on overall brain metabolisms at different ages will open a new window for future therapeutic intervention. This intervention will reduce their susceptibility to neurodegenerative conditions in women trying to give up nicotine addiction.

Understanding the biochemical networks that underlie metabolic homeostasis and how they associate with insulin action will help unravel diabetes etiology and should foster discovery of new biomarkers of disease risk and severity. We examined differences in plasma concentrations of >350 metabolites in fasted obese T2DM vs. obese non-diabetic African-American women, and utilized principal components analysis to identify 158 metabolite components that strongly correlated with fasting HbA1c over a broad range of the latter (r?=??0.631; p<0.0001). In addition to many unidentified small molecules, specific metabolites that were increased significantly in T2DM subjects included certain amino acids and their derivatives (i.e., leucine, 2-ketoisocaproate, valine, cystine, histidine), 2-hydroxybutanoate, long-chain fatty acids, and carbohydrate derivatives. Leucine and valine concentrations rose with increasing HbA1c, and significantly correlated with plasma acetylcarnitine concentrations. It is hypothesized that this reflects a close link between abnormalities in glucose homeostasis, amino acid catabolism, and efficiency of fuel combustion in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. It is speculated that a mechanism for potential TCA cycle inefficiency concurrent with insulin resistance is “anaplerotic stress” emanating from reduced amino acid-derived carbon flux to TCA cycle intermediates, which if coupled to perturbation in cataplerosis would lead to net reduction in TCA cycle capacity relative to fuel delivery.

This disorder is associated with pre-term delivery, fetal death, maternal hemorrhagic shock, and renal failure. Several physiologic disturbances, such as oxidative stress, carbohydrate/fatty acid metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction, have been associated with ischemic placental disorder as well as with placental abruption. This preliminary study proposes to identify metabolites associated with incident placental abruption using existing serum and clinical data from a previously studied cohort. Metabolomics analysis will be carried out on maternal serum (51 cases and 51 controls) collected in early pregnancy (early second trimester).

In addition to the absence of estrogen, progesterone, and HER2/neu receptors, TNBCs possess characteristics that make them some of the most aggressive forms of breast cancer (BCa). In terms of epidemiology, breast cancers with the triple negative profile present at a higher prevalence in premenopausal women under the age of 40, usually with a BMI greater than 30, and have higher incidences of mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. Additionally, several studies have shown a higher prevalence in African American women, demonstrating a health disparity. In spite of this knowledge and the fact that most people respond to initial chemotherapeutic treatment, lasting treatment modalities used for the cure and maintenance of other BCa subtypes generally fail to significantly increase disease-free survival or diminish the rates of recurrence within the first five years after initial detection of TNBC. Our ultimate goal is to identify novel biomarkers which may be leveraged for initiating prevention strategies in high risk populations, earlier detection, or targeted treatment of this disease.

In the U.S., African-American (AA) women suffer disproportionately from breast cancer mortality compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Both social (socioeconomic factors, diet, obesity) and biological hypotheses (gene polymorphisms, gene expression profiling) have been advanced to explain these discrepancies, but the differences remain poorly understood. Multiple aspects of tumor aggressiveness have been identified in the AA population, including a high proportion of basal-like tumors. Basal-like tumors are clinically the most aggressive, characterized by enhanced cancer stem cell-like features. Currently, no effective molecular therapies exist for these highly aggressive cancers and patient survival is poor. Escalating this disparity is the disease promoting effects of obesity and metabolic syndrome, which are significantly higher in AA women. Obesity and its associated inflammation have been attributed to poor patient outcomes, resistance to chemotherapeutics, and/or cancer risk. A meta-analysis of 43 studies of obesity and breast cancer revealed that obese patients were 33% more likely than non-obese patients to die of breast cancer. Yet apart from correlative studies, no reports have combined these factors with cancer disparities to ascertain their molecular interactions and physiology on breast tumorigenesis. We tested the integration these factors, with focus on a specific molecule, Lipolysis Stimulated Lipoprotein Receptor (LSR), in the promotion of aggressive cancer behaviors. LSR is a cell surface molecule that regulates post-prandial lipid uptake in the liver, is sensitive to high fat diets, and is regulated by metabolic cues, including leptin. By testing each of these factors as well as their dynamic interactions on breast cancer tumorigenesis, we will gain valuable insight into biological mechanisms that influence cancer risk/disparities, response to therapy, and ultimately patient outcome. We recently reported LSR is overexpressed in breast tumors, directs aggressive breast cancer cell behaviors including proliferation and migration, and enhances cancer stem cell-like and chemotherapeutic resistance features in breast cancer cells.

We recently discovered a novel role of abnormal cellular intermediary metabolism in hypertension in the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rat, the most commonly used polygenic, hereditary model of human salt-sensitive hypertension. We propose to test the hypothesis that blood pressure sensitivity to dietary salt intake in human is associated with metabolite changes in the urine. Leveraging the expertise and resources at the Mayo Clinic Metabolomics Resources Core, we propose to perform targeted LC/MS analysis and NMR spectra generation in urine samples obtained from a subset of subjects from the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension – Sodium (DASH2) clinical trial and kidney tissue extract and urine samples from SS rats and a newly generated transgenic rat that overexpresses fumarase (SS.Fh1+). The study will be the first to systematically characterize urinary metabolite profiles associated with blood pressure response to salt in humans. The study is anticipated to generate new insight into the mechanisms (particularly renal mechanisms) underlying salt-sensitive hypertension. Findings of the proposed study could lead to an expanded clinical study as well as mechanistic studies in animal models.

The mainstay of treatment to improve lower limb symptoms is supervised walking therapy, which does not affect plaque morphology or alter conduit artery blood flow, but rather ameliorates endothelial dysfunction, enhances skeletal muscle metabolism and mitochondrial function, and suppresses inflammatory activation. In this pilot feasibility project we will employ metabolic and lipidomic techniques to measure the effects of supervised exercise therapy on primary metabolism, complex lipids, and lipid mediators, and correlate these effects with individual, subject-level measures of the response to exercise therapy among subjects with PAD. The overarching theme of this work is to identify metabolites, complex lipids, and lipid mediators that are associated with the inter-individual variability in the response of subjects with PAD to supervised exercise therapy. This knowledge will significantly enhance our understanding of the pathophysiology of lower extremity symptoms in PAD, as well as the manner in which supervised exercise therapy improves walking intolerance. It will identify novel therapeutic targets and pathways for pharmacologic manipulation in the treatment of PAD. Aside from having the potential to generate multiple high-impact publications, it will serve as the basis for a planned NIH R01 submission by the PI at the conclusion of the award period.

Little is known about the exact mechanisms of insulin resistance in PCOS and how metformin can improve insulin sensitivity, increase the frequency of ovulation and lower androgens in PCOS. Preliminary data from metabolomic analyses of amino acids demonstrate increased concentrations of lysine and its metabolite, a-aminoadipic acid (AAA), in PCOS versus obese controls. Interestingly, greater AAA concentrations predicted the development of type 2 diabetes in the Framingham epidemiologic cohort, experimentally lowers glucose in animal models and increases insulin secretion in vitro. To date, the mechanism for increased circulating concentrations of lysine and AAA in insulin-resistant individuals is not known. Building upon these findings, we have initiated a project to simultaneously study lysine and AAA kinetics for the first time in insulin-resistant individuals using stable isotope tracer methodology. We will evaluate: 1) whether lysine and AAA kinetics are altered in PCOS versus healthy controls; 2) the effect of hyperinsulinemia on lysine and AAA kinetics in PCOS versus controls; 3) whether treatment to improve insulin sensitivity changes lysine and AAA kinetics in PCOS. The long-term goal is to target pathways for the treatment of PCOS and the prevention of type 2 diabetes in PCOS and other insulin-resistant individuals at greater risk for type 2 diabetes.

Our study provides information on the metabolic profiles of maternal and fetal placental tissues delivered by cesarean section and reveals that there are different metabolic alterations in the maternal and fetal tissues of the placenta following delivery.

Our specific aims were to: 1) test feasibility of enrollment and implementation; 2) assess acceptability of weekly food deliveries; and 3) estimate the preliminary effect size of the intervention relative to the usual care group on (a) maternal gut butyrate composition measured in three maternal stool samples collected at two time points during pregnancy (pre- and post-diet intervention phase) and also collected at 6 weeks postpartum; and (b) infant gut butyrate composition measured in infant stool samples collected at 6 weeks of age. The overall goal of PEAPOD was to gather pilot data to effectively refine the intervention so that it can be tested in a larger, longer study using a factorial design. For this pilot, we employed a 2-arm RCT with a total sample size of 27 mother-child pairs. We enrolled women in mid-pregnancy who were intending to breastfeed, randomized them to the diet intervention (n=13) or to a usual care group (n=14) and followed them to 6 weeks postpartum. Data collection included surveys of detailed maternal dietary information, as well as collection of maternal blood, urine, and stool at three time points (25 and 36 weeks gestation, and 6 weeks postpartum), and an infant stool sample at 6 weeks of age along with information about infant feeding practices. The diet intervention was initiated at 32 weeks gestation and continued until birth of the baby; thus the 25 week gestation biospecimens are pre-intervention and the 36 week gestation biospecimens are after 4 weeks of receiving the diet intervention. We chose to collect the second set of biospecimens at 36 weeks gestation to avoid missing post-intervention samples in instances where women delivered preterm. We partnered with the hospital catering service and the diet intervention including either legumes (e.g. minestrone with white beans) or whole grains (e.g. beef barley), and 5 pieces of fresh fruit (e.g. apples, oranges). In addition, in the first week, participants received a collection of non-perishable high fiber foods (whole wheat breakfast cereal, oatmeal, dried fruit, and canned beans) as well as upscale olive oil and vinegar from a local store along with recipes for salad dressing, side dishes, and some general information about the health benefits of the Mediterranean diet. We anticipated that participants would likely share the food with their families but our intent was to provide enough supplementary food to increase the fiber consumption of the pregnant women.

Asthma is also the number one cause of school absences in America. The role of indoor allergen exposure in homes and asthma development and morbidity has been extensively studied. Because children spend a significant amount of time in school, the school classroom environment may be as significant a source of allergen exposure and consequent asthma morbidity as allergen exposure in the home. However, little is known about the role of allergen exposure in schools and asthma morbidity. We hypothesize that exposure to common indoor allergens in the classroom will increase the risk of asthma morbidity in inner-city children with asthma, even after controlling for home allergen exposures. In a longitudinal study of 300 elementary school-aged children with asthma from multiple classrooms in close to 40 inner-city schools, we will examine the following specific aims: 1) to test whether elevated levels of allergens in the classroom increase the risk of asthma morbidity, even after controlling for allergen exposure in the home; and 2) to test whether the risk of increased asthma morbidity in relation to elevated classroom levels of a specific allergen will be highest for those specifically sensitized to that allergen. An understanding of exposure risk factors specific to the school classroom is critical, because the school classroom environment could potentially be considered as an effective target for prevention of inner-city asthma morbidity by reducing exposures to many symptomatic children through school- based interventions. While the potential importance of the classroom environment to the health of asthmatic children has been recognized nationally, study of this area has lacking. This unique application will build on significant collaborations between the Channing Laboratory at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Children's Hospital Boston, the Harvard School of Public Health, the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and the Boston Public School System. Our multidisciplinary research group has significant expertise in asthma epidemiology and environmental epidemiology (Drs. Phipatanakul and Gold), environmental assessment (Drs. Phipatanakul, Gold, Muilenberg, and Rogers), and statistics (Drs. Ryan, Hoffman, and Subramanian). In addition to its public health relevance, this proposal will recruit a unique school pediatric cohort that will facilitate future hypothesis testing. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Asthma is a disease that affects more than 12% of Americans under the age of 18 for over 14 million missed school days per year, and is the number one cause of school absences in America. Elementary school children spend 6 to 10 hours a day in school, and most of that time is spent in one classroom. The goals of this project are to provide an understanding of exposure risk factors specific to the classroom. This is critical, because the classroom environment could potentially be considered as an effective target for prevention of inner-city asthma morbidity by reducing exposures to many symptomatic children through an intervention in the school classrooms.; SICAS 2: Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the United States, causes significant morbidity, particularly in the inner-city, and accounts for billions of dollars in health care utilization, despite aggressive measures to identify remediable causes. Home environments are established sources of exposure that exacerbate symptoms and home-based interventions are proven effective. Prior to the inception of the School Inner-City Asthma Study (SICAS-1), no American study had comprehensively evaluated the relationship between urban exposures in school, classroom, and home environments and asthma morbidity. Nearly all elementary school children spend 6 to 10 hours a day in school, and most of that time is spent in one classroom. From SICAS-1, we learned that student classroom-specific mouse allergen, mold, and particulate pollutant exposure is associated with worsening symptoms. We also demonstrated our ability to reduce these exposures in a busy, school setting. Our proposal builds upon our established, successful school-based infrastructure to determine whether a school/classroom intervention will efficiently and effectively improve asthma morbidity by reducing these exposures. Our goal is to determine the efficacy of school/classroom based environmental intervention in reducing asthma morbidity in urban schoolchildren. Our central hypothesis is that reducing classroom/school exposure to mouse allergen, mold, and particulate pollutants will decrease asthma morbidity in students with asthma. We plan to test this hypothesis in an intervention study of 300 elementary students with asthma from multiple classrooms in 40 Boston inner-city elementary schools. Our clinical trial aims are to determine the effectiveness of a school/classroom based environmental intervention (school integrated pest management and classroom air purifying filter units within these schools) to reduce asthma morbidity.This study is an unprecedented, high impact opportunity to test whether we can efficiently benefit a community of children in the school environment as opposed to individuals in single homes. It also adds a novel mechanistic application on health outcomes. It efficiently tackles a critical public health problem that affects a growing proportion of disadvantaged, urban U.S. children.

In this investigation, global serum and liver tissue metabolomes were assessed analytically in wild type and CAR-null transgenic mice using NMR, GC/MS and UPLC/MS-MS-based metabolomics. Significantly, CAR activation increased serum levels of fatty acids, lactate, ketone bodies and tricarboxylic acid cycle products, whereas levels of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, amino acids and liver glucose were decreased following short-term activation of CAR. Mechanistically, quantitative mRNA analysis demonstrated significantly decreased expression of key gluconeogenic pathways, and increased expression of glucose utilization pathways, changes likely resulting from down-regulation of the hepatic glucose sensor and bi-directional transporter, Glut2. Short-term CAR activation also resulted in enhanced fatty acid synthesis and impaired ß-oxidation. In summary, CAR contributes an expansive role regulating energy metabolism, significantly impacting glucose, and monocarboxylic acid, as well as fatty acid metabolism and lipid homeostasis, through receptor-mediated regulation of several genes in multiple associated pathways.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the brain as well as degeneration of motor and non-motor circuitry. The cause of neuronal death is currently unknown, although chronic neuroinflammation, aggregated a-synuclein, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress have all been implicated. Gliosis has been shown to exacerbate neuroinflammation via secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and there is a subsequent infiltration of T lymphocytes (T-cells), into the brain of PD patients. Using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), we have observed metabolomic changes in stool samples, thought to be associated with the potential disease-modifying effect of an immunotherapy administered to transgenic Parkinsonian (A53T) mice. Significant elevations (p<0.05) in metabolites associated with immune response (taurine, histamine and its methylated product, 3-methylhistamine) are identified as being higher in the mice undergoing immunotherapy. Furthermore, a reduction in triacylglycerols (TG) and diacylglyceols (DG) expression in stool following immunotherapy suggests a regulation of lipid breakdown or biosynthesis with the vaccine. These “omics” markers (among others reported in this article) along with weight gain and increased life expectancy suggest that the immunotherapy is positively modifying the disease state.

Medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, has high propensity to metastasize. Currently, the standard treatment for MB patients includes radiation therapy administered to the entire brain and spine for the purpose of treating or preventing against metastasis. Due to this aggressive treatment, the majority of long-term survivors will be left with permanent and debilitating neurocognitive impairments and, for the 30-40% patients that fail to respond to radiation, all will relapse with terminal metastatic disease. An understanding of the underlying biology that drives MB metastasis is lacking, and is critically needed in order to develop targeted therapeutics for its prevention. To examine the metastatic biology of sonic hedgehog (SHH) MB, the human MB subgroup with the worst clinical outcome, we first generated a robust SmoA1-Math-GFP mouse model that reliably reproduces human SHH MB whereby metastases can be visualized under fluorescence microscopy. Lipidome alterations associated with metastasis were then investigated by applying Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS) under both positive and negative ionization modes to primary tumor samples collected from mice with (n=18) and without (n=7) metastasis. This study provides the first insights into dysregulations of lipid metabolism associated with SHH MB metastatic progression, and thus serves as a guide toward novel targeted therapies.

To capture in high resolution the sequence of metabolic events underlying the normal human pregnancy, we carried out an untargeted metabolome investigation on 784 weekly blood samples (3 outlier samples are removed) collected from 30 Danish pregnant women. The study revealed extensive metabolome alterations over the course of normal pregnancy: of 9,651 detected metabolic features, 4,995 were significantly changed (FDR < 0.05). Many metabolic changes were timed precisely according to pregnancy progression so that the overall metabolic profile demonstrated a highly choreographed pattern. Using machine-learning methods, we were able to build a linear models with five metabolites (four steroids and one phospholipid) that predicts gestational age with high accuracy (Pearson correlation coefficient, R = 0.95).

Thy1-ChR2-EYFP mice and controls (C57BL/6) were divided in four groups each, no crush and no stimulation, no crush and stimulation, crush and no stimulation, crush and stimulation. After euthanasia, the optic nerves were collected for analysis. The Bligh and Dyer method was used for lipid extraction, followed by mass spectrometry lipid profiling on a high-resolution Q-Exactive instrument.

Improvements in serum lipid concentrations may play a role in these observed associations. Objective: We investigated how dietary patterns differing in glycemic load affect a clinical lipid panel and plasma lipidomics profiles. Methods: In a crossover, controlled feeding study, 80 healthy participants (n=40 men, n=40 women), 18-45 y were randomized to receive low-glycemic load (LGL) or high glycemic load (HGL) diets for 28 days each with at least a 28-day washout period between controlled diets. Fasting plasma samples were collected at baseline and end of each diet period. A clinical lipid panel including total-, VLDL-, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides were measured using an auto-analyzer. Lipidomics analysis using mass-spectrometry provided the concentrations of 863 species. Linear mixed models were used to test for a diet effect. Results: Lipids from the clinical panel were not significantly different between diets. Lipidomics analysis showed that 67 lipid species, predominantly in the triacylglycerol class, differed between diets (FDR<0.05). A majority of these were higher after the LGL diet compared to the HGL. Conclusion: While the clinical lipid measures did not differ between diets, some lipid species were higher after the LGL diet in the lipidomics analysis. The two diets were eucaloric and had similar percentage of energy from carbohydrate, protein and fat. Thus, the difference in macronutrient, particularly carbohydrate, quality of the LGL diet is likely affecting the composition of lipid species.

PTN expression levels are upregulated in the nigrostriatal pathway of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) patients. We aimed to characterize the dopaminergic injury and glial activation in the nigrostriatal pathway of mice with transgenic Ptn overexpression in the brain (Ptn-Tg) after intrastriatal injection of the Parkinsonian toxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). The injection of 6-OHDA induced a significant decrease of the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neurons in the substantia nigra and of the striatal TH contents in Wild type (Wt) mice. In contrast, these effects of 6-OHDA were blocked in Ptn-Tg mice. 6-OHDA injection did not cause robust changes in microglia but induced an exacerbated astrocytic response in Wt mice compared with Ptn-Tg mice. In metabolomics studies, we detected interesting metabolites that significantly discriminate the more injured 6-OHDA-injected Wt striatum and the more protected 6-OHDA-injected Ptn-Tg striatum. Particularly, we detected groups of metabolites, mostly corresponding to phospholipids, whose trends were opposite in both groups. In summary, the data confirm the neuroprotective effect of brain PTN overexpression in this mouse model of PD. New lipid-related PD drug candidates emerge from this study and the data presented here support the increasingly recognized “lipid cascade” in PD.

Preterm birth is the leading cause of infant mortality worldwide, and also greatly increases the risk of developing serious health complications in childhood and throughout life. Conditions that contribute to preterm birth remain largely unclear, though an influence by environmental exposures is suspected but poorly understood. In our preliminary work, we found that exposure to common chemicals, such as phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA), may contribute to this serious but understudied public health problem. We also observed strong associations between phthalates/BPA and general markers of oxidative stress, and in turn between these general markers of oxidative stress and risk of preterm birth. In this nested case-control study within an ongoing cohort of pregnant women in Puerto Rico (PROTECT), we will explore untargeted lipidomics, as well as levels of eicosanoids specific to arachidonic acid oxidation pathways, in relation to both environmental exposures and preterm birth.

Endocrine therapy (ET) aimed at preventing hormone receptor activation is the primary treatment strategy, however, about half of the patients, develop resistance in time. This involves the development of hormone independent tumors that initially are ET-responsive (HI), which may subsequently become resistant (HIR). The mechanisms that promote the conversion of HI to HIR tumors are varied and not completely understood. The aim of this work was to characterize the metabolic adaptations accompanying this conversion through the analysis of the polar metabolomes of tumor tissue and non-compromised mammary gland from mice implanted subcutaneously with HD, HI and HIR tumors from a medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)-induced BC mouse model. This was carried out by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of tissue polar extracts and data mining through multivariate and univariate statistical analysis. Initial results unveiled marked changes between global tumor profiles and non-compromised mammary gland tissues, as expected. More importantly, specific metabolic signatures were found to accompany progression from HD, through HI and to HIR tumors, impacting on amino acids, nucleotides, membrane percursors and metabolites related to oxidative stress protection mechanisms. For each transition, sets of polar metabolites are advanced as potential markers of progression, including acquisition of resistance to ET. Putative biochemical interpretation of such signatures are proposed and discussed.

We identified 3-aminoisobutyrate and trigonelline with significantly higher levels in the ZIKV-infected patients, while 11 metabolites (fucose, 2-hydroxyglutarate, N-acetyl-glutamine, dimethylamine, 4-hydroxyphenethyl alcohol, creatinine, lactate, threonine, histidine, pseudouridine, and 1-methylnicotinamide) had significantly lower levels. We also identified 2 metabolites, including glucose and 1-methylnicotinamide, where the trends over time of the intensity levels between the two groups were significantly different. These metabolites suggested further study on tryptophan, NAD+, pyrimidine, and glucose metabolisms. These metabolomic changes may lead us to a better understanding of mechanisms that cause poor fetal outcomes as well as effects of virus infection on human pregnancy.

These dipeptides facilitate glycolysis by proton buffering, form conjugates with reactive aldehydes, such as acrolein, and attenuate ischemia and reperfusion injury. While these dipeptides exhibit multifunctional properties, a composite understanding of their roles in myocardium is lacking. To identify the landscape of histidyl dipeptide mediated responses in the heart, we used a triomics approach of genome wide RNA sequencing, global proteomics and unbiased metabolomics in the cardio specific Carns transgenic (Tg) mice and integrated the three data sets. Our result show higher myocardial levels of histidyl dipeptides lead to extensive changes in several microRNAs, which could target the expression of contractile proteins, beta-fatty acid oxidation and citric acid cycle (TCA) enzymes. Global proteomics shows, expression of contractile proteins, enzymes of beta-fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle, were enriched in the CarnsTg heart. Under aerobic conditions, the CarnsTg hearts had lower levels of short and long-chain fatty acids and TCA cycle intermediate-succinic acid, whereas, under ischemic conditions the accumulation of fatty acids and TCA cycle intermediates were significantly attenuated in the CarnsTg heart. Integration of multiple data sets suggests that beta-fatty acid oxidation and TCA cycle pathways exhibited correlative changes in the CarnsTg hearts at all three levels. Our triomics approach shows histidyl dipeptides are critical regulators of myocardial structure, function and energetics.

ONC retains retinal ganglion cells within the retina, while degenerating axons. In transgenic bacterial channel rhodopsin expressing cells, light stimulation promotes regeneration. Genetically matched wild-type uninjured optic nerves, or control transgenic mice, were also analyzed. Metabolites were carefully extracted from finely minced optic nerve tissue using a solvent system (initial separation using 1:1 Methanol and H2O and second extraction using 8:1:1 of Acetonitrile:Acetone:Methanol). Untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) profiling was performed using fractionation on a Vanquish Horizon Binary UHPLC. Subsequent analyses were performed on an inline coupled Q-Exactive Orbitrap instrument. Metabolites were identified using Compound DiscovererTM software. Statistical analysis was performed using MetaboAnalyst 5.0.

The research component is a population-based prospective longitudinal environmental epidemiologic cohort study addressing the potential adverse impact of chemical and non-chemical environmental exposures in mother/child dyads in Suriname. The study determines associations between exposures to neurotoxicants (metals and pesticides) and essential elements and non-chemical stressors in pregnant women and the impact on birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The study population consists of culturally diverse pregnant women (n=1143; ages: 16-49 years) and their babies/children (n=1069). Data collection takes place twice prenatally, at birth, 12, 36, and 48 months. Through HHEAR, targeted and untargeted (metabolomics) analyses will characterize exposure to metals in a sub-cohort of pregnant women for whom exposure data are not yet available. This expanded exposure analysis will enable a more comprehensive cumulative risk assessment of adverse birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes in the overall cohort.

It is therefore essential to understand their interaction with cellular barriers such as skin. In this work we evaluated the metabolic changes in human skin cells (HaCaT) exposed to different GRMs for 7 and 30 days. Objectives Endogenous metabolic profiles of control and graphene-treated keratinocytes have been studied using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). Keratinocytes were treated with graphene oxide (GO) from two different suppliers and with few layer graphene (FLG). Samples were collected one week and one month after the start of the treatment. The general aim of the project was to evaluate potential metabolic differences between: 1) Graphene-treated keratinocytes and control keratinocytes at one week; 2) Graphene-treated keratinocytes and control keratinocytes at one month; 3) Control keratinocytes at 1 month and 1 week; 4) Graphene-treated keratinocytes at 1 month and 1 week. Experimental Procedures A successful metabolic profiling experiment relies on the ability to determine changes in an organism’s biofluid or tissue complement of metabolites. Mass spectrometry coupled to ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC-MS) is well suited to such analyses due to its high sensitivity, large coverage over different classes of metabolites, high throughput capacity, and wide dynamic range. In this study, one UHPLC-MS based platform was used to analyse endogenous analytes for inclusion in subsequent statistical analysis procedures used to study metabolic differences between the groups of samples.

Increased resistance and significant side effects continue to limit the efficacy of anti-BCa drugs, hence the need to identify new drug targets and to develop novel compounds to overcome these limitations. Nature-inspired anti-cancer compounds are becoming increasingly popular since they often provide a relatively safe and effective alternative. In this study, we employed multi-omics techniques to gain insights into the novel and potentially relevant mechanism of action of two recently identified nature- inspired anti-cancer compounds (SIMR 3066 and SIMR 3058). Discovery proteomics analysis combined with LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed on compound-treated vs. DMSO-treated control MCF-7 cells. Downstream protein functional analysis showed that most of the responsive proteins were functionally associated with antigen processing and neutrophil degranulation, RNA catabolism and protein folding as well as cytoplasmic vesicle lumen and mitochondrial matrix formation. Consistent with the proteomics findings, metabolomic pathway analysis suggested that SIMR compounds could alter metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, metabolomics-based enriched-for-action pathway analysis showed that the of two SIMR compounds associate with mercaptopurine and thioguanine and azathiprine. Lastly, joint proteomics and metabolomics analysis revealed that treatment of BCa with SIMR3066 disrupts several signaling pathways including such p53-mediated apoptosis and the circadian entertainment pathway. Overall, the multi-omics we used in this study seems potent at probing the mechanism of action of novel anti-cancer agents.

RGCs and their optic nerve axons undergo irreversible neurodegeneration in glaucoma and associated optic neuropathies, resulting in blindness in mammals. Conversely, Xenopus demonstrates RGC lifetime-spanning regenerative capabilities after optic nerve crush, inciting opportunities to compare de novo regeneration and develop efficient pharmaceutical approaches for vision restoration. Studies revealing lipidome alterations during optic nerve regeneration are sparse and could serve as a solid foundation for these underlying molecular changes. We profile the lipid changes in a transgenic line of 1 year old Xenopus laevis Tg(islet2b:gfp) frogs that were either left untreated (naïve) or had a monocular surgery of either a left optic crush injury (crush) or sham surgery (sham). Matching controls of uninjured right optic nerves were also collected (control). Tg(islet2b:gfp) frogs were allowed to recover for 7,12,18, and 27 days post optic nerve crush. Following euthanasia, the optic nerves were collected for lipidomic analysis. A modified Bligh and Dyer method [PMID: 13671378] was used for lipid extraction, followed by untargeted mass spectrometry lipid profiling with a Q-Exactive Orbitrap Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer (LC MS-MS) coupled with Vanquish Horizon Binary UHPLC LC-MS system.

Here, we hypothesized that exposures to ETs are associated with obesity and insulin resistance via a dysbiotic gut microbiota and derived alterations in microbiome-mediated bile acid (BA) synthesis. Methods: Serum BAs, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and additional twenty-seven ETs were measured by mass spectrometry in 264 Danes (121 women and 143 men, age 56.6 ± 7.3 years, BMI 29.7 ± 6.0 kg/m2). Bacterial species were identified based on whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing of DNA extracted from purified stool samples. Personalized genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) of gut microbial communities were developed to elucidate regulation of BA pathways. Subsequently, we compared findings in the human study with metabolic implications of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure in a PPAR?-humanized murine model. Results: Fasting serum concentrations of twelve ETs associated directly with measures of obesity and insulin resistance. Several bacterial species including Dorea longicatena, Dorea formicigenerans, Subdoligranulum spp., Veillonella spp., and Roseburia intestinalis associated positively and in a sex-dimorphic manner, particularly in women, with high exposure to ETs. Moreover, high serum concentrations of ETs were linked with higher fasting serum levels of microbiome-synthesized secondary BAs such as lithocholic acid (LCA) and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). These findings were substantiated by the outcome of a murine exposure study. Conclusion: Serum concentrations of ETs, particularly in women, were associated with an altered gut microbiome-mediated secondary BA biosynthesis, linked with obesity and insulin resistance.

Distinguishing ovarian cancer (OC) from other benign or cancerous gynecological malignancies remains a critical unmet medical need with significant implications on patient survival. Substantially better results are observed when women with OC are correctly diagnosed and ensured the right treatment. However, non-specific symptoms along with our lack of understanding of OC pathogenesis hinder its diagnosis, consequently leading to a very low survival rate. Accumulating evidence suggests the link between OC and deregulated lipid metabolism. Most studies, however, are limited by small sample sizes and metabolite coverage, thereby constraining the robustness of the results. Here, we performed a comprehensive serum lipidome profiling of OC and various other gynecological malignancies (non-OC). A relatively large patient cohort with 208 OC and 137 non-OC patients, including 93 OC patients with early-stage OC, was recruited from two independent clinical sites in South Korea. Samples were analyzed with high-coverage liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry, providing extensive lipidome coverage with 994 successfully annotated lipid features. Lipidome differences between OC and other gynecological malignancies were investigated via statistical and machine learning approaches. Our data suggest that lipidome alterations unique to OC can be detected as early as when the cancer is localized, and those changes amplify as the diseases progresses. Comparison of the relative lipid abundances revealed specific patterns based on lipid class with most lipid classes showing decreased abundance in ovarian cancer. This study provides a systemic analysis of lipidome alterations in OC, emphasizing the potential of circulating lipids as a complementary class of blood-based biomarkers for OC diagnosis.

It also poses significant difficulty in finding novel early diagnostics, understanding biochemical pathways, monitoring patients, and prognosis. Any metabolite found in a biofluid, or tissue may act as a driver, signal, or both in the emergence or spread of the disease. As a result, metabolomics is a very useful strategy in this therapeutic setting. Broad metabolite coverage is essential since it strives to offer a representative image of a biological system. An untargeted metabolomics-based method was used in this cross-sectional study to identify metabolomic changes and their relationship to pathways in the Arabic gum patient group and control participants. Plasma samples were collected from 88 participants who met the inclusion criteria, of whom 43 control patients were treated with a placebo and 45 intervention patients were treated with Arabic gum. Highly sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to analyze the plasma samples (UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS). We investigated the effect of Arabic gum on individual metabolites using a two-tailed independent student t-test. The results showed that 31 out of 92 identified metabolites were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.05). L-Leucine and 5'-Methylthioadenosine were the significantly increased metabolites in the Arabic gum group. Conversely, triethylamine, D-limonene, 4-methylphenylacetic acid, and sphingosine levels were significantly lower in the Arabic gum group compared to the control. Arabic gum primarily affected multiple metabolic pathways, including glycine and serine, arginine and proline, valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation, phenylalanine and tyrosine, urea cycle, and sphingolipid. The results from this study provide insights into the potential diagnostic significance of different metabolites in chronic kidney disease and their impact on specific metabolic pathways. However, further research involving larger cohorts is necessary to validate the observed metabolite changes following Arabic gum intake and their diagnostic value for chronic kidney disease.

Cancer cell metabolism plays a critical role in tumor growth and progression, and metabolic alterations in cancer cells have been implicated in treatment resistance. In this study, we performed metabolomic analysis using ovarian cancer cells derived from patients in the United States and Korea. Our results reveal significant ethnic-specific differences in the metabolic signatures of ovarian cancer cells, with differential regulation of metabolites derived from glycolytic pathways, lipid metabolism, and microbiome modified metabolites. These findings have important therapeutic implications, as differences in ovarian cancer metabolism between ethnic groups may influence treatment response and resistance. Targeting the unique metabolic signatures of ovarian cancer cells based on ethnic specificity may improve the effectiveness of precision medicine approaches in the treatment of ovarian cancer. This study highlights the potential for personalized and targeted therapeutic options based on the tumor metabolome and ethnic background of the patient. Overall, our results suggest that investigating ethnic-specific differences in cancer metabolism is critical for developing effective and personalized cancer therapies. The identification of unique metabolic signatures in ovarian cancer cells based on ethnic specificity provides a promising avenue for improving treatment outcomes and advancing the field of precision medicine in ovarian cancer.

Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) exhibit a high risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) which is not fully explained by the classical Framingham risk factors. SLE is characterized by major metabolic alterations which can contribute to the elevated prevalence of CVD. In order to address this hypothesis, a comprehensive analysis of the circulating metabolome and lipidome was conducted in a large cohort of 211 women with SLE who underwent a multi-detector computed tomography scan for quantification of coronary artery calcium (CAC), a robust predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD). Results. Beyond traditional risk factors, including age and hypertension, disease activity and duration were independent risk factor for developing CAC in women with SLE. The presence of coronary calcium was associated with major alterations of circulating lipidome dominated by an elevated abundance of ceramides with very long chain fatty acids. Alterations in multiple metabolic pathways, including purine, arginine and proline metabolism, and microbiota-derived metabolites, were also associated with CAC in women with SLE. Backward stepwise logistic regression models of lipidomic and metabolomic variables were used to develop prognostic scores. Strikingly, combining metabolic and lipidomic variables with clinical and biological parameters markedly improved the prediction (area under the curve: 0.887, P<0.001) of the presence of coronary calcium in women with SLE. Conclusion. The present study uncovers the contribution of disturbed metabolism to the presence of coronary artery calcium and the prediction of CHD in SLE. Identification of novel lipid and metabolite biomarkers may help stratifying patients for reducing CVD morbidity and mortality in SLE.

Metabolomics provides a snapshot of dynamic biochemical activities, including those found to be driving tumor formation and progression. This study used untargeted metabolomics with network analysis to agnostically identify network modules and independent metabolites in pre-diagnostic blood samples among never-smokers to further understand the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Methods and Findings: Within the prospective Shanghai Women’s Health Study, we conducted a nested case-control study of 395 never-smoking incident lung cancer cases and 395 never-smoking controls matched on age. We performed liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry to quantify 20,348 metabolic features in plasma. We agnostically constructed 28 network modules using a weighted correlation network analysis approach and assessed associations for network modules and individual metabolites with lung cancer using conditional logistic regression models, adjusting for covariates. We accounted for multiple testing using a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.20. We identified a network module of 122 metabolic features enriched in lysophosphatidylethanolamines that was associated with all lung cancer combined (p = 0.001, FDR = 0.028) and lung adenocarcinoma (p = 0.002, FDR = 0.056) and another network module of 440 metabolic features that was associated with lung adenocarcinoma (p = 0.014, FDR = 0.196). Metabolic features were enriched in pathways associated with cell growth and proliferation, including oxidative stress, bile acid biosynthesis, and metabolism of nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and amino acids, including 1-carbon compounds.

Lactation has substantial effects on mother’s metabolism and VA is required in multiple biological processes, including growth, vision, immunity, and reproduction. The objective of this pilot study was to utilize metabolomics profiling to conduct a broad, exploratory assessment of differences in plasma metabolites associated with low VA status versus VA adequacy in lactating women. Plasma samples from lactating women who participated in a survey in Samar, Philippines, were selected from a cross-sectional study based on plasma retinol concentrations indicating low (VA-; n=5) or adequate (VA+; n=5) VA status (plasma retinol <0.8 or >1.05 µmol/L). The plasma results collected from six metabolomics assays (oxylipins, endocannabinoids, bile acids, primary metabolomics, biogenic amines, and lipidomics) were compared by group using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Twenty-eight metabolites were altered in the VA- versus VA+ status groups, with 24 being lipid mediators (p<0.05). These lipid mediators included lower concentrations of arachidonic acid- and eicosapentaenoic acid-derived oxylipins, as well as lysophospholipids and sphingolipids, in the VA- group (p<0.05). Chemical similarity enrichment analysis identified HETEs, HEPEs, and DiHETEs as significantly altered oxylipin clusters (p<0.0001, false discovery rate (FDR) p<0.0001), as well as sphingomyelins, saturated lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylethanolamines (p<0.001, FDR p<0.01). The multi-assay nutritional metabolomics profiling of low VA status compared with adequacy in lactating women was characterized by reduced lipid mediator concentrations. Future studies with stronger study designs and larger sample size are needed to confirm and validate these preliminary results.

Understanding mechanisms underlying atrial myopathy has important implications for understanding and preventing atrial fibrillation (AF). Prior work had shown that PI3K is an essential regulator of exercise-induced ventricular enlargement and protection, but the role in the atria was unknown. Further, while targeting IGF1-PI3K-Akt signaling has been considered a potential therapeutic strategy for the failing heart, growing evidence suggests fine-tuning IGF1-PI3K signaling would be necessary. Here, we undertook comprehensive physiological and molecular analyses in cardiac-specific transgenic mice with increased or decreased PI3K to assess the dose response impact of directly regulating PI3K. Elevated PI3K was associated with a dose-dependent increase in heart size, and preserved/enhanced function. In contrast, reduced PI3K led to cardiac dysfunction, fibrosis, arrhythmia, and increased susceptibility to atrial enlargement and thrombi. This phenotype was associated with dysregulation of a lipid species (GM3) that regulates the IGF1-PI3K pathway, cardiac stress and contractility genes. Proteomic profiling identified distinct signatures across atria with varying degrees of atrial dysfunction, enlargement, and presence of atrial thrombi. To assess the potential relevance in humans we assessed circulating PI3K-related lipids in plasma from athletes with/without AF. Dysregulation of GM3 and PI3K-related lipids were identified in athletes with AF. Collectively, this work advances our understanding of mechanisms underpinning atrial pathophysiology, offers new insights for therapeutic approaches targeting atrial myopathy and AF, and has identified potential new lipid markers for identifying individuals at risk of AF.

Among its subtypes, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which poses significant clinical challenges due to its aggressive behavior and limited treatment options. Aim: This study explored the effects of doxorubicin (DOX) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as monotherapies and in combination on MDA-MB-231 xenograft model. Employing advanced metabolomics analysis, the study was designed to investigate molecular alterations triggered by these treatments. Methods: State-of-the-art metabolomics analysis using Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) was conducted including comprehensive plasma and tumor tissue sample profiling. Results: The study explored alterations induced by DOX, 5-FU, and their combination treatment. Each treatment group exhibited unique metabolic profiles in plasma and tumor analysis. Univariate and enrichment analyses identified alterations in metabolic pathways, including glycine and serine metabolism, spermidine and spermine biosynthesis, and purine and pyrimidine pathways. The combination of DOX and 5-FU significantly influenced plasma and tumor metabolites. The comprehensive metabolic profiling of both plasma and tumor samples shed light on the intricate changes within the tumor microenvironment and their systemic implications. Conclusion: The study findings offer insights into the metabolic vulnerabilities of TNBC in vivo induced by the studied chemotherapeutics. These findings highlight the involved metabolites and metabolic pathways in the response of MDA-MB-231 cells to DOX, 5-FU, and their combination which advance our understanding of TNBC treatment strategies, offering new possibilities for enhancing therapeutic outcomes.

Methods: Eighteen eumenorrheic women (BMI 18-25 kg/m2) were studied in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle before and after exposure to a HFD with frequent blood sampling for LH and FSH, followed by an assessment of pituitary sensitivity to GnRH. Mass spectrometrybased plasma metabolomic analysis was also performed. Paired testing and time series analysis were performed as appropriate. Results: Mean endogenous LH (unstimulated) was significantly decreased after the HFD (4.3 ±1.0 vs 3.8 ± 1.0, P&lt;0.01); mean unstimulated FSH was not changed. Both LH (10.1 ± 1.0 vs 7.2 ± 1.0, P&lt;0.01), and FSH (9.5 ± 1.0 vs 8.8 ± 1.0, P&lt;0.01) response to 75 ng/kg of GnRH were reduced after the HFD. Mean LH pulse amplitude and LH interpulse interval were unaffected by the dietary exposure. Eucaloric HFD exposure did not cause weight change. Plasma metabolomics confirmed adherence with elevation of fasting free fatty acids (especially long-chain mono-, poly- and highly-unsaturated fatty acids) by the last day of the HFD. Conclusion: One-month exposure to a HFD successfully induced key reproductive and metabolic features of Reprometabolic Syndrome in normal weight women. Dietary factors may underly the gonadotrope compromise seen in obesity related subfertility and that therapeutic dietary interventions, independent of weight loss, may be possible.

Apart from the heightened susceptibility to chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity significantly escalates healthcare costs. Effective public health strategies are essential for addressing issues related to early detection, diagnosis, and personalized treatment plans. This emphasizes the crucial need for a deep understanding of biochemical pathways, patient monitoring, and prognosis. In this context, metabolomics has become a valuable approach, focusing on the identification of metabolites in biofluids and tissues.In this study, an untargeted metabolomics-based method was employed to investigate metabolomic changes and their relationship to pathways in overweight and obese individuals. Plasma samples were collected from 29 healthy individuals with normal weight, 17 overweight individuals, and 28 obese individuals who met the inclusion criteria for the study. The plasma samples were analyzed using highly sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Pantothenic acid and L-proline showed increased levels in the overweight group, whereas phenylacetaldehyde and glycerophosphocholine were notably decreased compared to the normal weight group. Conversely, the obese group exhibited elevated levels of specific metabolites, including L-leucine, L-tryptophan, phenylalanine, and tyrosine. On the contrary, the obese group demonstrated decreased levels of other metabolites such as 2,3-Diaminopropionic acid, and phenylacetaldehyde. Additionally, significant changes in metabolic pathways, such as pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, and beta-alanine metabolism, were observed in the overweight group. In contrast, the obese group displayed significant alterations in phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and beta oxidation of very long-chain fatty acids. The present investigation sheds light on the potential diagnostic significance of certain metabolites in obesity and the impact of their level changes on specific metabolic pathways. Additional studies are necessary to confirm the association of these metabolites in obesity and to confirm their diagnostic value.

Notably, differentiation diagnosis of abnormity detected by ultrasound findings (e.g., thickened endometrium or mass in the uterine cavity) is essential and remains challenging in clinical practice. Herein, we identified a metabolic biomarker panel for differentiation diagnosis of EC using machine learning of high-performance serum metabolic fingerprints (SMFs) and validated the biological function. We first recorded the high-performance SMFs of 191 EC and 204 Non-EC subjects via particle-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (PELDI-MS). Then, we achieved an area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 0.957-0.968 for EC diagnosis through machine learning of high-performance SMFs, outperforming the clinical biomarker of cancer antigen 125 (CA-125, AUC of 0.610-0.684, P &lt; 0.05). Finally, we identified a metabolic biomarker panel of glutamine, glucose, and cholesterol linoleate with an AUC of 0.901-0.902 and validated the biological function in vitro. Therefore, our work would facilitate the development of novel diagnostic biomarkers for EC in clinics.

Data indicate that postmenopausal women have a higher incidence of mood disorders, and this high vulnerability seems to be related to hormonal changes and weight gain. Although research evaluating the profile of metabolites in mood disorders is advancing, further research, maintaining consistent methodology, is necessary to reach a consensus. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to carry out an exploratory analysis of the plasma polar metabolites and lipids of pre- and postmenopausal women to explore whether the profile is affected by depression. The study was performed in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo (nº 0624/2019) and all participants signed the informed consent. 42 premenopausal and 67 postmenopausal women had the depression symptoms assessed by the Beck Depression's Inventory (BDI). Lipids and polar metabolites were extracted from plasma and analyzed in an ultra-performance liquid chromatography system (UHPLC) coupled to a spectrometer with a triple-quadrupole analyzer operating with an electrospray ionization source (ESI) in positive and negative mode. Lipids and polar metabolites analyses was performed using MetaboAnalyst 5.0. Ten metabolites were significantly affected by depression symptoms in postmenopause, including Adenosine, Guanosine, Proline, Citrulline, Lysine, and Carnitine, which were down-regulated, and Dimethylglycine, Glutathione, Creatine, and Methionine that were up-regulated. In premenopausal women with depression, Oxidized Glutathione was down-regulated, and Dimethylglycine and 4-hydroxyproline were up-regulated. Seven lipids were were significantly affected by depression symptoms in pre-menopausal women PC(36:1)/PC(18:1(9Z)/18:0), PC(19:0/19:0), and LTB4 were up-regulated and PC(18:0/14:0)/GPCho(18:0/14:0), SM(d18:1/16:0), LysoPC(18:1(9z))/LPC 18:1, and Azelaoyl-PAF were down-regulated. In post-menopausal women PC(16:1(9z)/16:1(9z)) and 14,15-DHET were down-regulated and acetylcarnitine was up-regulated. Though there seems to be a relationship in the occurrence of obesity and depression in women the hormonal status influenced the effect of depression in women and that this status may be taken into account when searching for a marker for depression.

Low protein diets are associated with healthy aging in humans, and many independent groups of researchers have shown that dietary protein restriction (PR) extends the lifespan and healthspan of mice. Here, we examined the effect of PR on metabolic health and the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in the 3xTg mouse model of AD. We found that PR has metabolic benefits for 3xTg mice and non-transgenic controls of both sexes, promoting leanness and glycemic control in 3xTg mice and rescuing the glucose intolerance of 3xTg females. We found that PR induces sex-specific alterations in circulating metabolites and in the brain lipidome, downregulating sphingolipid subclasses including ceramides, glucosylceramides, and sphingomyelins in 3xTg females. Consumption of a PR diet starting at 6 months of age reduced AD pathology in conjunction with reduced mTORC1 activity, increased autophagy, and had cognitive benefits for 3xTg mice. Finally, PR improved the survival of 3xTg mice. Our results demonstrate that PR slows the progression of AD at molecular and pathological levels, preserves cognition in this mouse model of AD, and suggests that PR or pharmaceutical interventions that mimic the effects of this diet may hold promise as a treatment for AD.

We and others have reported a central role for the actin-bundling protein (fascin) in regulating breast cancer disease progression at different levels. However, whether fascin expression promotes metabolic molecules that could predict disease progression has not been fully elucidated. Here, fascin expression was manipulated via knockdown (fascinKD+NORF) and rescue (fascinKD+FORF) in the naturally fascin-positive (fascinpos+NORF) MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Whether fascin dysregulates metabolic profiles that are associated with disease progression was assessed using untargeted metabolomics analyses via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. An overall of 12,226 metabolites were detected in the tested cell pellets. Fascinpos+NORF cell pellets showed 2,510 and 3,804 significantly dysregulated metabolites compared to their fascinKD+NORF counterparts. Fascin rescue (fascinKD+FORF) revealed 2,710 significantly dysregulated cellular metabolites compared to fascinKD+NORF counterparts. 101 overlapped cellular metabolites between fascinKD+FORF and fascinpos+NORF were significantly dysregulated in the fascinKD+NORF cells. Analysis of the significantly dysregulated metabolites by fascin expression revealed their involvement in the metabolism of sphingolipid, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, which are critical pathways for breast cancer progression. Our findings of fascin-mediated alteration of metabolic pathways could be used as putative poor prognostic biomarkers and highlight other underlying mechanisms of fascin contribution to breast cancer progression.

Most ER+ breast cancers (BC) express androgen receptors (AR). This randomized phase II trial of 4 months of neoadjuvant fulvestrant (Fulv) alone or with enzalutamide (Combo) assessed whether the addition of AR blockade to Fulv would limit residual tumor at time of surgery, as measured by modified preoperative endocrine predictive index (PEPI) score. Eligible patients were women with ER+/HER2- primary BC cT2 or greater. Stratification factors were clinical node and T-stage. Fresh tumor biopsies were required at study entry, after 4 weeks on therapy (W5), and at surgery (W17). Laboratory analyses on tumors included immunochemistry (IHC) for ER/PR/AR/GR and Ki67 protein, evaluation of gene expression, multiplex for myeloid lineage immune cells, reverse phase protein array, and plasma metabolomic analyses. 59 out of 69 consented patients were evaluable. Toxicity was as expected with endocrine therapy. Combo achieved PEPI=0 more frequently (24%: 8/33) than Fulv (8%: 2/26). Ki67 was &lt;10% across arms by W5 or surgery in most patients (23/33 (70%) on Combo, 21/26 (81%) on Fulv). mTOR activation was elevated in tumors with poor Ki67 response. Tumors in both arms showed decreased estrogen-regulated and cell division gene sets, while Combo uniquely exhibited enrichment of immune activation genes sets, including interferon gamma, complement, inflammation, antigen processing, and B and T cell activation. Multiplex IHC showed significantly reduced tumor-associated macrophages and CD14+/HLADR-/CD68- MDSCs with Combo at W5. In summary, Combo achieved a higher PEPI=0 response, Ki67 response, and more activated tumor immune microenvironment than Fulv. The odds of response were 4.6-fold higher for patients with ILC versus IDC.

As different tissues have varying levels of radiosensitivity, e.g. hematopoietic vs. gastrointestinal tissues, the effects of shielding on radiation biomarkers needs to be addressed. Here, we explore how biofluid (urine and serum) metabolite signatures from male and female C57BL/6 mice exposed to VHDR (5 – 10 Gy/sec) total body irradiation (TBI, 0, 4, and 8 Gy) compare to individuals exposed to partial body irradiation (PBI) (lower body irradiated [LBI] or upper body irradiated [UBI] at an 8 Gy dose) using a data-independent acquisition untargeted metabolomics approach. Although sex differences were observed in the spatial groupings of urine signatures from TBI and PBI mice, a metabolite signature (N6,N6,N6-trimethyllysine, carnitine, propionylcarnitine, hexosamine-valine-isoleucine, taurine, and creatine) previously developed from variable dose rate experiments was able to identify individuals with high sensitivity and specificity irrespective of radiation shielding. A panel of serum metabolites composed from previous untargeted studies on nonhuman primates had excellent performance for separating irradiated cohorts; however, a multi-omic approach to complement the metabolome could increase dose estimation confidence intervals. Overall, these results support the inclusion of small molecule markers in biodosimetry assays without substantial interference from upper or lower body shielding.

Aquatic organisms can be chronically exposed to PhACs during critical periods of their life or even through multi-generations. This may result in severe physiological/metabolic/endocrine disturbances, not only through direct exposure but also through inter- and transgenerational inheritance (in the absence of the insult). Special attention is given to simvastatin, one of the PhACs most prescribed to humans for the primary treatment of hypercholesterolemia, known to affect endocrine functions and disrupt reproduction, development, neuronal processes and/or other important physiological responses; not only in exposed individuals, but also in subsequent non-exposed generations. Previous studies observed that direct exposure and transgenerational exposure to simvastatin has been found to impact severely on crustaceans’ reproduction, growth and development, although the underlying mechanism remains partially unclear. NMR metabolomic approaches may provide crucial complementary mechanistic information about the cascade of metabolic events occurring with exposure. In this study a comprehensive untargetd 1H NMR metabolomics study was applied to measure the metabolic effects of direct exposure to environmentally relevant concentrations of simvastatin (F0) and transgenerational exposure (F3, where only the F0 generation was exposed) on the keystone marine amphipod species Gammarus locusta. Furthermore, NMR is here employed for the first time to address G. locusta metabolic behavior. The obtained data added important knowledge, paving the way to an improved understanding of the metabolic events cascade associated with simvastatin exposure.

Isolated microglia were sorted based on reporter expression and their transcriptomic profiles acquired in both wildtype and APP transgenic animals, allowing us to disentangle TREM2 versus pathology-specific effects. Bulk RNA sequencing highlighted TREM2 level-dependent changes in major immunometabolic pathways, with enrichment of genes in oxidative phosphorylation and cholesterol metabolism in microglia with increased TREM2 expression. To confirm these findings, we next analysed uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and examined metabolomic and lipidomic profiles. Again, independent of Aβ pathology, TREM2 expression correlated with uptake of FDG as well as increased cellular redox, energetics, and cholesterol homeostasis. Finally, we performed chronic treatment with a brain penetrant TREM2 agonist and identified a window of TREM2 expression where microglia are most responsive. Thus, our data provide novel insights into TREM2-mediated regulation of microglial metabolic function and informs current efforts to bring TREM2 agonists into clinical application.

The underlying mechanisms, however, remain elusive. Methods To dissect functional, transcriptional and metabolic effects, hearts and isolated ventricular myocytes from mice harboring a moderate, cardiac-specific expression of a human ADRB3 transgene (β3AR-Tg) and subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) were assessed using echocardiography, RNAseq, PET scan, metabolomics, seahorse and metabolic flux analysis. Subsequently, signaling and metabolic pathways were investigated further in vivo in β3AR-Tg and in vitro in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes adenovirally infected to express β3AR and subjected to neurohormonal stress. These results were completed with an analysis of single nucleus RNAseq data from human cardiac myocytes from heart failure patients. Results Compared with WT littermate, β3AR-Tg mice were protected from hypertrophy after transaortic constriction (TAC), while systolic function was preserved. β3AR-expressing hearts displayed enhanced myocardial glucose uptake under stress in absence of increased lactate levels. Instead, metabolomic and metabolic flux analyses in stressed hearts revealed an increase in intermediates of the Pentose-Phosphate Pathway (PPP) in β3AR-Tg, an alternative route of glucose utilization, paralleled with increased transcript levels of NADPH-producing and rate-limiting enzymes of the PPP, without fueling the hexosamine metabolism. The ensuing increased content of NADPH and of reduced glutathione decreased myocyte oxidant stress, while downstream oxidative metabolism assessed by oxygen consumption was preserved with higher glucose oxidation in β3AR-Tg post-TAC compared to WT, together with increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Unbiased transcriptomics and pathway analysis identified NRF2 (NFE2L2) as upstream transcription factor which was functionally verified in β3AR-expressing cardiac myocytes where its translocation and nuclear activity was dependent on β3AR activation of nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) NO production. Conclusion Moderate expression of cardiac β3AR, at levels observed in human cardiac myocardium, exerts antioxidant effects through activation of the PPP and NRF2 pathway, thereby preserving myocardial oxidative metabolism, function and integrity under pathophysiological stress.

The goal of this study was to examine relationships between maternal microbial taxa, fecal metabolites, and maternal anthropometry on incidence of LBW in resource-limited settings. This was a secondary analysis of the Women First trial conducted in a semi-rural region of Guatemala. Maternal weight was measured at 12 and 34 weeks (wk) of gestation. Infant anthropometry measures were collected within 48 h of delivery. Maternal fecal samples at 12 and 34 wk were used for microbiome (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) and metabolomics analysis (34 wk only). Linear mixed models using the MaAslin2 package were utilized to assess changes in microbiome associated with LBW. Predictive models using gradient boosted machines (XGBoost) were developed using the H2o.ai engine. No differences in β-intrinsic variation were observed at either time point between mothers with LBW infants relative to normal weight (NW) infants. Simpson intrinsic variation at 12 and 34 wk was lower in mothers with LBW infants. Notable differences in genus-level abundance between LBW and NW mothers (p&lt; 0.05) were observed at 12 weeks with increasing abundances of Barnesiella, Faecalibacterium, Sutterella, and Bacterioides. At 34 weeks, there were lower abundances of Magasphaera, Phascolarctobacterium, and Turicibacter and higher abundances of Bacteriodes, and Fusobacterium in mothers with LBW infants. Fecal metabolites related to bile acids, tryptophan metabolism and fatty acid related metabolites changed in mothers with LBW infants. Classification models to predict LBW based on maternal anthropometry and predicted microbial functions showed moderate performance. Collectively, the findings indicate that less beneficial gut microbes and circulating metabolites of the mother is associated with low birth weight infants compared to normal weight. Future research should target functional and predictive roles of the maternal gut microbiome in infant birth outcomes including birthweight.

Study Design: This case-control study included 20 women undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF), comparing 10 women diagnosed with UI to 10 control women whose male partners had abnormal semen parameters. FF samples were collected during oocyte retrieval and analysed using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography and reversed-phase liquid chromatography, coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on a Q-TOF mass spectrometer. Metabolites were identified using XCMS Online and MetaboAnalyst, followed by pathway enrichment analysis via the KEGG database. Statistical analyses including OPLS-DA and ROC analysis assessed their diagnostic potential. Metabolite levels were correlated with clinical parameters, including embryo development rates, oocyte maturation, and IVF outcomes. Results: In women with UI, 12 metabolites, including Diacylglycerols, Phosphatidic acids, Vitamin D3 glucosiduronate, 1α-hydroxy-2β-(5-hydroxypentoxy) vitamin D3, Asparginyl-Asparagine, Lithocholic acid, Leu-Pro-Ala-Ser-Phe, Triacylglycerols, Phosphatidyl choline, Phosphatidylethanolamine and Lactosyl ceramide were significantly decreased, while Ile-Lys-Val-Val was significantly increased compared to controls. These metabolites were linked to glycerophospholipid metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, and steroid synthesis pathways. PLS-DA, OPLS-DA, and ROC analysis indicated high diagnostic performance, with AUC values exceeding 0.8. Additionally, Vitamin D3 glucosiduronate levels negatively correlated with embryo development rates, while Asparginyl-Asparagine levels demonstrated a positive correlation with the MII oocyte rate. Conclusion: This study constitutes the first comprehensive characterization of metabolic dysregulation in the FF of women with UI, offering novel insights into the underlying mechanisms contributing to this condition and advocates for routine assessment of vitamin D3 levels in serum/FF of these women.

Early detection and treatment of this malignancy provides the best prognosis, but the lack of accurate and sensitive screening tools combined with the presence of ambiguous symptoms hinders these diagnoses. In contrast, screening for cervical cancer via Papanicolaou (Pap) tests is a widespread practice with use spanning the past several decades, reducing this cancer’s morbidity and mortality rates. Two types of Pap smear tests exist: a conventional method where cells from the ectocervix are stained on a glass slide and a liquid-based cytology method. Interestingly, previous studies show evidence of OC cells in Pap tests, suggesting that lipids shed from ovarian tumors may end up in the cervix. The goal of this study is to evaluate the practicality of using liquid-based Pap tests as biospecimens for OC screening-related metabolic studies. Cell pellets from liquid-based Pap tests from 29 healthy women were analyzed via ultra-high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS). This approach facilitated the detection and annotation of 453 unique lipids across 20 lipid subclasses, including ceramides, triacylglycerols, and hexosylceramides. These results demonstrated the feasibility of using an MS-based approach to analyze residual Pap test samples for the discovery of OC-related lipid biomarkers with the goal of detecting OC at early stages of the disease.

Chronic stress, indicated by elevated cortisol levels, may mediate this disparity by dysregulating inflammatory responses driving BC tumorigenesis. However, the role of cortisol in ER+ BC remains underexplored. Objective: To explore associations between pre-treatment plasma cortisol, inflammatory proteins, tumoral gene expression changes, and neighborhood disadvantage in women with primary ER+ BC compared to cancer-free controls. Methods: Pretreatment plasma samples were collected from women with primary ER+ BC (n=98) and cancer-free controls (n=144). Tumor samples were obtained from a subset of cases (n=77). Samples were obtained from three Chicago hospitals serving disadvantaged or advantaged neighborhoods. Plasma samples were analyzed via a steroid hormone metabolomics assay and Olink Proteomic’s inflammatory proteins panel. Gene expression in tumor samples was analyzed via the Breast Cancer 360 Nanostring panel. Univariate single -omics analysis was performed using a mixed model and multi-omics data integration was performed using the mixOmics R package. Results: Among all cases vs. controls, cortisol-related metabolites were elevated in cases (p&lt;0.05), with the cortisol/cortisone ratio remained significantly elevated in disadvantaged cases vs. controls (p&lt;0.01) but not advantaged cases vs. controls. In disadvantaged individuals, 62 inflammatory proteins were elevated (p&lt;0.05), including five weakly correlated with the cortisol/cortisone ratio (p&lt;0.05). Genes upregulated in disadvantaged vs. advantaged cases were those involved in inflammation and cell cycle regulation, while downregulated genes were those involved in anti-inflammation (p&lt;0.05). Motif analyses showed NFKB as a top motif (p&lt;0.01), suggesting dysregulated immune/inflammation and cortisol signaling. Integrative multi-omics analysis further supported dysregulation in inflammatory signaling correlated with altered cortisol metabolism. Conclusion: BC diagnosis in disadvantaged individuals is associated with elevated cortisol, potentially contributing to elevated circulating inflammatory proteins and tumoral gene expression changes that promote tumor progression.

Integrating metabolomics in sports science provides valuable insights into the biochemistry during physical activity. However, due to their invasiveness, traditional blood sampling methods present challenges in sports settings. The study investigated sex-specific metabolic responses, addressing a significant gap in exercise research, where female participation remains underrepresented. METHODS. To address this, we explored volumetrically accurate microsampling (VAMS) as a dried blood spot (DBS) technique for assessing metabolomic changes in response to acute exercise in more than 130 participants. This study employed a targeted quantitative approach using isotopically-labeled internal standards to measure over 100 metabolites in DBS, providing accurate and traceable results. An accuracy assessment using standard reference material and stability testing over 90 days further evaluated the suitability of DBS for sports metabolomics. RESULTS. Our findings confirm that DBS offers a valid approach to capturing metabolic changes during exercise, reporting a wide panel of metabolites including key metabolites of energy pathways, which correlate well with plasma-derived data but also less studied classes such as pyrimidines. Implementing a straightforward standardization concept established metabolic perturbations upon bout exercise as differences of absolute concentrations. CONCLUSIONS. While metabolic regulations upon exercise are similar in both sexes, differences in the correlation with fitness-related metadata such as peak volitional oxygen consumption (V̇O2peak) and performance, indicate a higher complexity in women and a limitation of previous knowledge to men only. The quantification approach together with the simplicity of the sampling paves the way to expand this type of research towards other fields of personalized medical services.

Women with a GDM history are 7 times more subject to develop type 2 diabetes compared to healthy pregnant women. Metabolic alteration during pregnancy has been suggested as an underlying cause of GDM. Metabolomics of collected blood from GDM pregnant women indicate that GDM is associated with alteration of amino acids, fatty acids, and glycolysis. However, deep metabolomics analysis to identify complicated and unique pathways that can guide prognosis and treatment are not fully determined particularly with Middle Eastern women. Developing such data in comparison to published data will help to provide more understanding of the disease progression and for target treatment. Methods: In this research, we utilized metabolomics-assisted technology to identify dysregulated metabolic pathways and metabolites in pregnant women with GDM compared to healthy pregnant women. Trapped ion mobility spectrometry time-of-flight TIMS-QTOF MS was employed on blood samples collected from 32 GDM pregnant women in comparison to 20 healthy pregnant women. This was followed by significant statistical analysis including two-tailed independent Student's t-test, P&lt;0.05 will be considered significant. These findings facilitate clear understanding of underlying metabolic pathways and early detection of GDM and hence will enable effective targeting treatment. Results: The student t-test analysis was used, 33 of the 108 metabolites that were discovered had statistical significance (p&lt;0.05) when compared between the two groups. When compared to the control group, which consists of normal pregnant women, the gestational diabetes group had significantly lower levels of citramalic acid, creatinine, D-arginine, and glutamine, while the group with gestational diabetes had higher levels of 4-aminohippuric acid, homovanillic acid, alpha-aspartyl-lysine, L-aspartyl-L-phenvlalanine, L-valine, L-leucine, and normetanepherine. Conclusion: Understanding specific metabolic interactions aids pregnant GDM patients in comprehending many factors affecting their metabolic environment. In addition to enhancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying GDM, this knowledge makes it possible to explore targeted therapeutics for its management or prevention by altering unusual metabolomic pathways.

This study aimed to characterize the metabolic alterations associated with subtypes and disease pro-gression using an untargeted metabolomics approach in a cohort of newly diagnosed, treat-ment-naive Colombian women. Samples were analyzed using LC-QTOF-MS and GC-QTOF-MS, along with amino acid profiling to improve metabolite coverage. Alterations consistent with previous studies were identified; however, the Luminal B subtype showed elevated levels of long-chain acylcarnitines, along with higher concentrations of free fatty acids compared to other subtypes. It also presented elevated levels of carbohydrates and essential glycolytic intermediates, suggesting that this subtype may adopt a hybrid metabolic phenotype characterized by increased glycolytic flux as well as enhanced fatty acid catabolism. TNM (Tumor, Node, Metastasis) staging analysis showed progres-sive metabolic reprogramming of breast cancer. In advanced stages, a sustained increase in phosphatidylcholines and a decrease in lysophosphatidylcholines were observed, reflecting lipid alterations associated with key roles in tumor progression. In early stages (I-II), plasma metabo-lites with high discriminatory power were identified, such as pyrrolidone glutamic acid, ribose, and glycerol, which are associated with dysfunctions in energy and carbohydrate metabolism. These results highlight metabolomics as a promising tool for early diagnosis, clinical follow-up, and molecular characterization in breast cancer.

Following log transformation and imputation of missing values, if any, with the minimum observed value for each compound, ANOVA contrasts were used to identify biochemicals that differed significantly between experimental groups. A summary of the numbers of biochemicals that achieved statistical significance (p≤0.05), as well as those approaching significance (0.05&lt;p&lt;0.10), is shown below. Analysis by two-way ANOVA identified biochemicals exhibiting significant interaction and main effects for experimental parameters of time and treatment. An estimate of the false discovery rate (q-value) is calculated to take into account the multiple comparisons that normally occur in metabolomic-based studies. For example, when analyzing 200 compounds, we would expect to see about 10 compounds meeting the p≤0.05 cut-off by random chance. The q-value describes the false discovery rate; a low q-value (q&lt;0.10) is an indication of high confidence in a result. While a higher q-value indicates diminished confidence, it does not necessarily rule out the significance of a result. Other lines of evidence may be taken into consideration when determining whether a result merits further scrutiny. Such evidence may include a) significance in another dimension of the study, b) inclusion in a common pathway with a highly significant compound, or c) residing in a similar functional biochemical family with other significant compounds.

This study aimed to identify metabolic biomarkers associated with BC progression in the UAE population. A total of 135 metabolites were detected using LC/MS-MS, of which 15 were significantly different between the two groups (q-value &lt; 0.05). Notably, 4 metabolites including hypoxanthine, allantoic acid, 2-phenylbutyric acid, and uridine were significantly upregulated in BC patients (FC &gt; 1.5, q-value &lt; 0.05). However, 11 metabolites including vitamin D3, N-acetylputrescine, 9-methyluric acid, thyroxine, indoleacetic acid, guanidine, L-arginine, guanidinosuccinic acid, androstenedione, L-homocysteic acid, and PC (18:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)) were significantly downregulated in BC patients relative to HC (FC=0.2-0.6, q-value &lt; 0.05). Further analysis was conducted to identify specific biomarkers between early and late-stage BC. Compared to HC, L-arginine, guanidine, isocitric acid, guanidinosuccinic acid, indoleacetic acid, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, and thyroxine levels were significantly (q-value &lt; 0.05) downregulated only in early BC patients reflecting altered metabolic pathways critical to early tumor development particularly those involved in amino acid and energy metabolism. In late stage BC, pipecolic acid and estradiol were found to be significantly (q-value &lt; 0.05) increased only in patients with late-stage BC compared to HC (healhty control), indicating an enhanced lysine degradation and hormonal dysregulation. However, PC (18:1(9Z)/18:1(9Z)), urea, androstenedione, 9-methyluric acid were significantly (q-value &lt; 0.05) reduced in late BC patients compared to HC indicating metabolic reprogramming that favor tumor progression. Hypoxanthine and allantoic acid were significantly upregulated in both early- and late-stage BC. Vitamin D3, N-acetylputrescine, urocanic acid, L-homocysteic acid were significantly downregulated in both early- and late-stage BC. Further, significant increase (FC=4.75, q-value &lt; 0.05) in biotin levels was observed in patients with high proliferative tumor (Ki-67 &gt; 14%) compared to patients with low proliferative (Ki-67 &lt; 14%), indicating that this metabolite is important for cancer cell proliferation and further investigations are warranted to identify its role in BC cells proliferation. All these alterations indicates that the tumor is in increased demand for specific metabolites to support rapid proliferation and survival, highlighting potential opportunity for biomarker development and therapeutic intervention. Collectively, the metabolomics analysis revealed significant metabolic alterations between BC patients and HC, with distinct upregulation and downregulation of key metabolites linked to tumor progression, proliferation, and stage-specific metabolic reprogramming. The main metabolic pathway altered in BC patients is amino acid metabolism, particularly arginine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, and lysine metabolism. These pathways are critical for providing biosynthetic precursors, supporting energy demands, and facilitating tumor proliferation and progression, making them potential targets for biomarker development and therapeutic intervention.

Sympathetic nerve stimulation increases BAT activity in rodents. Reports that signaling from the stellate ganglion (SG) modulates thermogenesis in humans, raises the possibility that minimally-invasive approaches to stimulate sympathetic projections from the SG to supraclavicular BAT (scBAT) have potential as an anti-obesity therapy. The neuroanatomy of the SG is complex, because sympathetic and sensory neuronal axons leave the ganglion through 6-8 different exit points to reach a wide variety of targets in the periphery. For neuromodulation of SG projections to BAT to have clinical applications, it is essential that stimulation protocols avoid projections from the SG to the heart and upper extremities. In theory, this can be achieved by physically focusing the electrical stimulus to SG neurons as they exit the SG or enter the scBAT depot. Alternatively, genetic approaches could be used restrict pharmacological manipulations to the subpopulation of SG neurons that innervates BAT. These complementary studies in mouse models and human tissue samples will serve as the basis for deciding which of these strategies are viable therapeutic options. The proposed studies are designed to fill critical information gaps and to develop tools needed for comprehensive mapping of neural circuits regulating BAT and to explore the potential use of BAT neuromodulation as an anti- obesity therapy. Studies in Aim 1 will use combinations of transgenic mouse models and fluorescent neuronal tracers to determine whether there is any physical overlap between BAT and forelimb-projecting soma within the SG or their exit points out of the SG. In parallel, we will perform the first mapping studies of the projections from the SG to scBAT in human autopsy specimens. A major obstacle to studies to modulate or record neural activity in the SG is that this ganglion contains many different types of afferent and efferent neurons that regulate a wide range of physiological functions. Studies in Aim 2 will define molecular markers for distinct subpopulations of SG neurons that project to BAT and heart. Then we will determine whether any of these markers are conserved in human surgical samples. Finally, studies in Aim 3 will establish systems to evaluate the impact of neuromodulation on the organization of sympathetic fibers in conjunction with well-established assays to measure BAT oxidative capacity and activity. To aid these efforts, we will develop techniques to image sympathetic projections in an intact BAT depot. In addition, we will validate key in vivo assays needed to assess the impacts of neuromodulation on BAT function that can be readily translated to humans. In addition to impacts on the BAT field, these studies will also provide a strong foundation for future efforts to understand how existing SG neuromodulation therapies have beneficial effects on a wide range of conditions that are refractory to other treatments, including ventricular tachycardia, chronic regional pain syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder."

Both conditions pose significant health and financial burden. Notably, IBS and IC/PBS present with considerable overlapping symptoms, whilst individual patients can suffer from both disorders concurrently. The colon and bladder cross-sensitize and share spinal innervations. However, despite increased understanding of their symptomatology and the role of pain afferents in their pathophysiology, there are no effective therapies. The few pharmacological drugs including opioids have significant adverse effects. Current barriers to the development of effective therapies for IBS and IC/PBS include: a) Inadequate structural and functional knowledge on the dichotomizing dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons of the distal colon and bladder. b) The lack of adequate investigation on sex differences in cross-organ sensitization, despite the prevalence of both conditions being higher in women than in men (female to male ratio: 2:1 for IBS, 5-10:1 for IC/PBS) c) Lack of knowledge of the sensory afferent innervation and cross-organ sensitization in species with higher translational relevance to humans. We propose to address these gaps through concurrent monitoring of the colon and bladder pain circuitries in two pre-clinical models and under 3 specific aims. 1): Structural mapping of colon and bladder pain afferent neurocircuits: Dichotomizing and non-dichotomizing neurons, their spatial distribution and connectivity. 2): Functional characterization of colon and bladder afferents in acute and chronic models of cross-organ sensitization and 3): Map spinal sites of colon and bladder pain and cross-organ sensitization through neuromodulation. We will use acute and chronic cross-organ sensitization models, state-of-the-art high- resolution imaging, 3D mapping, dual retrograde tracing of bladder and colon sensory neurons, CLARITY, ex vivo DRG Ca2+ imaging of dichotomizing neurons, ex vivo electrophysiological recordings from bladder and colon afferents and transcutaneous spinal stimulation (TSCS) approaches. The murine model will unravel the classes of pain afferents/neurons and their functional circuits in bowel-to-bladder and bladder-to-bowel acute and chronic pain cross sensitization. The porcine studies will provide novel information on the structural map of the colon and bladder dichotomizing neurons and their connections as well as cross sensitization of pain responses. It will also allow us to gain insight on the use of TSCS to map spinal cord circuits and backtrack colon and bladder pain circuits and its translational feasibility for human use. The combined multidisciplinary approaches will fill the gaps in current knowledge on the colon/bladder dichotomizing DRG neurons, spatial distribution and connections as well as the plasticity in the pain circuitries post sensitization. Our findings will contribute to the foundation for understanding colon and bladder neurocircuitries that will be critical for urgently needed drugs and/or neuromodulator therapies for chronic visceral pain syndromes such as IBS and IC/PBS."

The brain receives information in response to injury induced inflammation in the periphery which in turn initiates a reflex mechanism to suppress immune responses. The resulting neuroendocrine reflex plays an important regulatory role in the immune system. These bidirectional brain-peripheral immune communications operate reflexively, in a closed feedback loop whereby neural circuits can exert significant influence to modulate inflammation. However, the specific mechanisms underlying this brain-immune signaling are largely unknown. Therefore, understanding the distinct molecular and neurophysiological mechanisms that govern these complex pathways is critical, which motivates us to develop new approaches to accurately detect and monitor these changes. We will develop nanosensors for the detection of neurotransmitter release in the peripheral nervous system of axolotls (regenerating salamanders). Our nanosensors are based on a modular platform that can easily be tuned to an appropriate dynamic range, wavelengths for tissue penetration, and size to be compatible with the in vivo environment. The juvenile axolotl is highly transparent and nanosensors injected into the nervous system or organs will be imaged using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. In addition, we have the ability to genetically modify the system to develop a transgenic model that can be stimulated with light to target neuronal excitations, while simultaneously measuring neurotransmitter levels via the fluorescence emitted from the injected nanosensors. Combined, we will image volumetric release of acetylcholine in the peripheral nervous system and spleen of the axolotl, and will translate these results to a mammalian model by the end of the project period."

Importantly, opiates are ineffective at treating visceral pain syndromes, and only exacerbate discomfort by producing constipation, reflecting a clear need for alternative treatment options. The goal of this proposal is to bring greater mechanistic insight to this underserved area of pain research, and to approach the problem in a multifaceted strategy designed to maximize the relevance of our basic research discoveries to future pain treatments. Here, we will ask how enterochromaffin (EC) cells transmit noxious signals from the gut lumen to the spinal cord. EC cells are key sensory cells in the intestinal epithelium that release serotonin onto primary sensory nerve fibers, thereby evoking a sensation of discomfort and pain in response to luminal irritants, such as bacterial metabolites, inflammatory agents, or ingested chemicals. The goals of this collaborative effort are to use activating and silencing approaches to examine functional connections between EC cells and sensory nerve fibers. We will couple these methods with transcriptome profiling, viral tracing, and electrophysiological methods to gain insights into the molecular and functional identity of these fibers. Another key goal is to determine whether EC cell signaling pathways exhibit sex-specific differences, an important question that may relate to the higher prevalence of GI visceral pain syndromes experienced by women. Our team brings an unusually wide ranging and innovative approach to this area of pain research that includes expertise in the neurophysiology, pharmacology, and anatomy of nociceptive and pain circuits, visceral tissue anatomy and development, and relevant clinical experience. This knowledge base is supported by complementary technological approaches that will enable us to connect molecular and mechanistic insights to physiology, visceral nociception, and disease. Our focus on the epithelial-nociceptor connectome highlights EC and other enteroendocrine cell types as potentially powerful control points for neuromodulation of visceral discomfort and pain. A comprehensive functional, pharmacological, genetic and anatomical characterization of EC-primary afferent-spinal circuits is an essential first step toward achieving this important goal. As such, our research program fits squarely within the SPARC mandate to transform our understanding of peripheral nerve-organ interactions and advance strategies for controlling organ system function."

# Ingest C2M2
```bash
# To ingest controlled vocabulary files into c2m2 schema
python ingest_CV.py

# To ingest the c2m2 tables from files submitted by DCCs
python populateC2M2FromS3.py 2>&1 | tee MRM_ingestion.log
# If ingesting files from only one DCC (into schema mw), e.g., during per-DCC submission review and validation, can specify dcc_short_label as argument, e.g.,
python populateC2M2FromS3.py MW 2>&1 | tee MRM_ingestion_MW.log

# Other c2m2 related sql scripts
psql -h localhost -U drc -d drc -a -f c2m2_other_tables.sql

# After ingesting c2m2 files, create the table ffl_biosample by running (be in the database folder)
# ffl_biosample needs project_data_type, so, run c2m2_other_tables.sql first
psql -h localhost -U drc -d drc -a -f biosample_fully_flattened_allin1.sql;

# Ingest slim (and associated ontology) tables into a schema called 'slim', because c2m2 also has tables like anatomy, disease etc., which is likely to be a much smaller subset of the corresponding tables in the slim schema.
# The sql file is ingest_slim.sql, autogenerated by the shell script gen_ingest_slim_script.sh
# There is also the table dbgap_study_id.tsv ; for now, it will be in slim schema, if needed later, can be put in a schema called dbgap.
./gen_ingest_slim_script.sh ingest_slim.sql
psql -h localhost -U drc -d drc -a -f ingest_slim.sql

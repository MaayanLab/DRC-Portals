# CFDE Submission System Documentation

This page covers the submission system documentation of the Data Resource Portal. We are collecting file and code assets from Common Fund programs to make them Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) within the Data Resource Portal. To submit assets, you must be logged in and registered. Registration involves being assigned a role by an administrator. To register, please see Onboarding to the CFDE Data Portal Submission System.

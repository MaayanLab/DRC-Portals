### For All Assets: 

#### Persistent URL 

This metric checks whether a URL has been provided to a document that defines a data management plan for how the persistent identifier will be maintained. 
To improve this metric score, the digital object should be linked with a permanent URL (preferably a DOI) and should provide instructions for how the URL will be maintained.

### For All File Assets: 
#### Accessible via DRS

This metric checks whether the file asset is accessible via a data repository service (DRS). 
By default, all submitted file assets to the CFDE Workbench are available via DRS and receive a score of 1 for this metric. The DRS of a file asset is based on their sha256 checksum values: [drs://cfde.cloud/sha256sum](drs://cfde.cloud/{sha256sum}).  For example, the DRS of the MW_submission_packet_20240605.zip file asset is drs://cfde.cloud/5578a58fe27b45aa0ff6fcad3f72f65a88de17cc221aa771f000dcb6c0cd010b which can be accessed here by a DRS compatible client by

#### Machine readable metadata
This metric checks whether the C2M2 file is able to be read by the deriva_datapackage Python package, which is required to run the FAIR Assessment. To improve this score, ensure that the CSV Dialect for each resource as specified in data_package.json or C2M2_datapackage.json file correctly captures its file contents.

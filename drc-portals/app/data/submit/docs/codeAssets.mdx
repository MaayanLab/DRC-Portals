# File Asset Types


## ETL

Extract, transform, load (ETL) is the process of converting the DCC raw data into various processed data formats such as the C2M2, XMT, KG assertions, attribute tables, and database tables.The ETL URL should point to the DCC GitHub repo containing the scripts that process the data by the DCC to generate these processed datasets.

## API

It is expected that each DCC will have a URL to a page that documents how to access each DCC data and tools via APIs. Moreover, APIs should be documented in a standard format and the recommended standard is OpenAPI. In addition, it is recommended to deposit these API into the API repository SmartAPI.
OpenAPI: The OpenAPI specification provides a formal standard for describing REST APIs. OpenAPI specifications are typically written in YAML or JSON.
SmartAPI: This is a community-based repository for depositing APIs documented in the OpenAPI specification. It features additional metadata elements and value sets to promote the interoperability of RESTful APIs.
Learn more about generating an OpenAPI or SmartAPI specification on the Documentation page.
Example: [exRNA openAPI link](https://brl-bcm.stoplight.io/docs/exrna-atlas-json-api/ZG9jOjQ1Mg-overview)

## Playbook Workflow Builder (PWB) Metanodes

A PWB metanode is a workflow engine component implemented by defining the semantic description, typescript-constrained type, and functionality of a node in the network of PWB workflows. See Playbook Partnership documentation and Documentation page for more information about developing and publishing metanodes. The form requires a GitHub link to a script describing a Playbook metanode.
Example: [PWB Metanode created by the Metabolomics DCC](https://github.com/nih-cfde/playbook-partnership/blob/eece1eb07365d6255b44708b64606aa42eef5563/components/MW/metabolite_summary/index.tsx)

Entity Page Template and Example

The Entity Page Template and Example are links to:

A template used to create the landing page displaying the datasheet about a gene, a metabolite, and protein, a cell type, or other entities from a DCC;
The example URL provides a valid URL to an existing entity page that presents a single view of a given entity.

Example of a template from GTEx: https://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/<GENE_NAME>.

Example live entity page from GTEx: https://www.gtexportal.org/home/gene/MAPK3

## Chatbot Specifications

Chatbot specifications URL is a link to a manifest file containing metadata and OpenAPI specifications which can be used to develop a chat plugin for large language models. These plugins allow the large language models to function as specialized chatbots that have access to the exposed API endpoints described in the manifest files and can call these APIs based on user input. See ChatGPT plugins documentation for more information on how to develop chatbot specifications.
Example: [ai-plugin specs template](https://github.com/openai/plugins-quickstart/blob/3096542ef96b77f93d6b13a0ea105641c3763284/.well-known/ai-plugin.json)

## Apps URL

An Apps URL is a link to a page(s) that serves a listing of bioinformatics tools, workflows, and databases produced by the DCC.
Example: [LINCS Apps URL](https://lincsproject.org/LINCS/tools)

### Not Approved

This is the first stage of approval. All assets that are just uploaded or submitted by a DCC uploader will first be placed in this category. The asset will be tagged by the <FaCircleExclamation style={{ display: 'inline-flex', alignItems: 'center' }}/> icon on the Uploaded Assets page, icon which represents that the file was not reviewed by the DCC approver or evaluated by the DRC.

### DCC Approved

When an asset has been approved by a DCC approver (appointed by each DCC), the status of the asset will be updated to 'DCC Approved' which is tagged by the  <BsCheckCircleFill style={{ display: 'inline-flex', alignItems: 'center' }}/> icon under the DCC Status column on the Uploaded Assets page.

### DRC Approved

When an asset has been approved by an appointed DRC approver, the status of the asset will be updated to 'DRC Approved'. This status is tagged by the <BsCheckCircleFill style={{ display: 'inline-flex', alignItems: 'center' }}/> icon under the “DRC Status” column on the Uploaded Assets page. Please note that DCC and DRC approval status are independent of each other.

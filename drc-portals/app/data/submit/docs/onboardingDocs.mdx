# Onboarding to the Data Portal Submission System

### <u>User Roles</u>

As a Common Fund Data Coordinating Center (DCC) you have 3 role options for your users of the submission system:

- User: This is a general user of the platform who cannot upload, approve, or view non-public files. You can have as many users in this role as you want.
- Uploader: Can submit data packages, but can't approve data packages/files. Users can see files that they submitted for their DCC, but can't approve them. You can have as many users in this role as you want.
- Approver: Can submit new packages and approve a submitted package. You can have as many users in this role as you want.

Any given person in your DCC can only have 1 role. 

### <u>Onboarding Process</u>
To do onboarding and give a member of your DCC Approver or Uploader privileges, have the PI or PM of your DCC contact the DRC via email ([help@cfde.cloud](help@cfde.cloud)) with the following information about the concerned members: 
- Name
- Email
- Role
- DCC 

Please also indicate if the user has previously logged into the portal (has a user account) or has never accessed the portal (is a new user). 

When the user(s) have been registered, each of them will receive an email from a member of the DRC notifying them of their registration.  

### <u>Logging into the Portal after Registration</u>
1. You can log into the portal by entering the email address you were registered with into the email field here: 
2. You will be sent a registration confirmation link to that email. If you do not find the link in your inbox, please also check your spam folder as the email may be sent there.

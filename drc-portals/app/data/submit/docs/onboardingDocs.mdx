### User Roles

As a Common Fund Data Coordinating Center (DCC) you have 3 role options for your users of the submission system:

- User: These users are general users of the platform who cannot upload, approve, or view non-public files. You can have as many users in this role as you want.
- Uploader: Can submit data packages, but can't approve data packages/files. Users can see files that they submitted for their DCC, but can't approve them. You can have as many users in this role as you want.
- Approver: Cannot submit new packages but can approve a submitted package. These users can view and manage all files that have been submitted for their DCC. You can have as many users in this role as you want.
- Read-Only: These are users who can see view all pages of the submission system but will not be allowed to submit or approve packages. They can also view all the submitted assets all their assigned DCCs. This role is to be given to the NIH and the PMs of DCCs. You can have as many users in this role as you want. 

Any given person in your DCC can be assigned to multiple roles. 



### Onboarding Process
To do onboarding and give a member of your DCC Approver or Uploader privileges, have the PI or PM of your DCC contact the DRC via email ([help@cfde.cloud](mailto:help@cfde.cloud)) with the following information about the concerned members: 
- Full Name
- Email
- Role
- DCC 

Please also indicate if the user has previously logged into the portal (has a user account) or has never accessed the portal (is a new user). 

When the user(s) have been registered, each of them will receive an email from a member of the DRC notifying them of their registration.

# Archives

We are archiving select tools, databases, and portals from CFDE participating CF programs using low-cost [Amazon Glacier Deep Archive](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/s3-glacier/) for backup and archiving.

The hope is that these resources can still be restored in the future even if the funding to host them publicly is no longer available.

The archive is organized by DCC, application, and a timestamp of when the snapshot was created. Each snapshot is a `.zip` archive containing, hopefully, everything needed to bring it back up, including database dumps, source code, and docker containers to run the application and any dependencies.

The current set of archives are listed below:

<S3Browser />

They are accessible via [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), but please note that they are enabled with Requestor Pays. See [this user guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ObjectsinRequesterPaysBuckets.html) on how to access them.

If you'd like to add your own archive here, please [contact us](mailto:help@cfde.cloud) and we can work with you on building and uploading the archive.

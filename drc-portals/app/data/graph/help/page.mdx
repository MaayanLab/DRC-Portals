## Introduction

The CFDE C2M2 Graph Query Interface lets you explore CFDE datasets through an intuitive visual graph search powered by Neo4j—no query language knowledge required.

You can view an interactive version of the C2M2 Graph Schema [here](/data/graph/schema).

## Quick Start Tips

### __1. Start with a Keyword__

Enter a keyword (e.g., human, blood, asthma, RNA-seq, TP53, aspirin) to search ontology-encoded metadata, such as species, anatomy, disease/phenotype, gene, compound, and assay, to discover entities like Subject, Biosample, and File.

### __2. Build as You Explore__

Use node menu options (point the cursor/mouse to a node) — __Expand__ (to explore related entities), __Filter__ (to narrow by values), and __Prune__ (to trim paths) — to build your query one step at a time.

### __3. View & Download__

See results in __Tabular__ or __Network View__, and export them as JSON to share, revisit, or analyze further.

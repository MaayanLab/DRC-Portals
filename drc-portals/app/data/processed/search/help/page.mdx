# Search Help

## Introduction

The CFDE Workbench Processed Data Search allows searching across participating Common Fund programs' [contributed processed data](/data/contribute/documentation) which includes [Knowledge Graph Assertions](/info/standards/KGAssertions), the [Crosscut Metadata Model (C2M2)](/info/standards/C2M2) metadata about raw files, Attribute Tables and Sparse Matrices (XMTs). The files themselves and the contents of these processed data files can be located and related content navigated to.

## Quick Start Tips

Search works like many other search engines.

|Syntax|Explanation|
|-|-|
|`unquoted text`|text not inside quote marks will be converted to boolean AND|
|`"quoted text"`|text inside quote marks will be converted to bigrams (ordering preserved)|
|`or`|the word "or" will be converted to boolean OR|
|`-text`|a dash will apply an exclusion to the following text|

Here are some representative queries:

|Search text|Explanation|
|-|-|
|[nephropathy diabetic](https://data.cfde.cloud/data/processed/search?q=nephropathy+diabetic)|Finds records that contain both the term 'diabetic' and the term 'nephropathy', not necessarily in that order|
|[gtex or sparc](https://data.cfde.cloud/data/processed/search?q=gtex+or+sparc)|Matches any document from GTEx or sparc|
|["knowledge graph" -eqtl](https://data.cfde.cloud/data/processed/search?q=%22knowledge+graph%22+-eqtl)|Matches knowledge graph (but not graph knowledge) but not records containing "eqtl"|

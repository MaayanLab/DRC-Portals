## Reference Tables

Certain table fields within the C2M2 are restricted to only a few pre-defined values, such as `biosample_disease.association_type` or `subject.granularity`. Reference tables containing the allowed values for these fields, which were originally published on the [CFDE-CC Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/nih-cfde/published-documentation/wiki/C2M2-Table-Summary), are linked below:

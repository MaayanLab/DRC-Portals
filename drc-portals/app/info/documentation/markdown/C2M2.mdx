The Crosscut Metadata Model (C2M2) is a flexible metadata standard for describing experimental resources in biomedicine and related fields. A complete C2M2 submission, also called an "instance" or a "datapackage", is a zipped folder containing multiple tab-delimited files (TSVs) representing metadata records along with a JSON schema. To read more about datapackages, skip to the [Frictionless Data Packages](#frictionless-data-packages) section.

Each TSV file is a **data table** containing various **data records** (rows) and their values for different **fields** (columns). **Entity tables** describe various types of data objects, while **association tables** describe the relationships between different entities.

## Resources
The [cfde-c2m2](https://github.com/maayanlab/cfde-c2m2) repository includes a CLI helper for preparing, validating, and submitting your C2M2 submission.

## Frictionless Data Packages
C2M2 instances are also known as "datapackages" based on the [Data Package](http://frictionlessdata.io/docs/data-package/) meta-specification from [Frictionless Data](http://frictionlessdata.io/).

From the original C2M2 documentation:
> The Data Package meta-specification is a platform-agnostic toolkit for defining format and content requirements for files so that automatic validation can be performed on those files, just as a database management system stores definitions for database tables and automatically validates incoming data based on those definitions. Using this toolkit, the C2M2 JSON Schema specification defines foreign-key relationships between metadata fields (TSV columns), rules governing missing data, required content types and formats for particular fields, and other similar database management constraints. These architectural rules help to guarantee the internal structural integrity of each C2M2 submission, while also serving as a baseline standard to create compatibility across multiple submissions received from different DCCs.

## Identifiers
In order to standardize and integrate information across DCCs, there must be a system of assigning unambiguous identifiers to individual DCC concepts and resources. These are the "C2M2 IDs", consisting of a `id_namespace` prefix and `local_id` suffix. Additionally, the C2M2 also allows individual resources to be assigned a `persistent_id`.

From the original C2M2 documentation:
> Optional `persistent_id` identifiers are meant to be stable enough to be scientifically cited, and to provide for further investigation by accessing related resolver services. To be used as a C2M2 `persistent_id`, an ID
>    1. will represent an explicit commitment by the managing DCC that the attachment of the ID to the resource it represents is permanent and final
>    2. must be a format-compliant URI or a compact identifier, where the protocol (the "scheme" or "prefix") specified in the ID is registered with at least one of the following (see the given lists for examples of URIs and compact identifiers)
>        - the IANA (list of registered schemes)
>        - scheme used must be assigned either "Permanent" or "Provisional" status
>        - Identifiers.org (list of registered prefixes)
>        - N2T (Name-To-Thing) (list of registered prefixes)
>        - protocols not appearing in the above registries but explicitly approved by the CFDE-CC. Currently, this list is limited to one protocol, namely drs:// URIs identifying GA4GH Data Repository Service resources.
>    3. if representing a file, an ID used as a `persistent_id` cannot be a direct-download URL for that file: it must instead be an identifier permanently attached to the file and only indirectly resolvable (through the scheme or prefix specified within the ID) to the file itself

## C2M2 Tables

_Sourced from the [CFDE-CC Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/nih-cfde/published-documentation/wiki/C2M2-Table-Summary)_

All of the tables in a C2M2 datapackage are inter-linked via foreign key relationships, as shown in the following diagram of the complete C2M2 system.

## Reference Tables

Certain table fields within the C2M2 are restricted to only a few pre-defined values, such as `biosample_disease.association_type` or `subject.granularity`. Reference tables containing the allowed values for these fields, which were originally published on the [CFDE-CC Documentation Wiki](https://github.com/nih-cfde/published-documentation/wiki/C2M2-Table-Summary), are linked below:

- [All reference tables](https://osf.io/m3a85/)
  - [disease_association_type](https://osf.io/ap6gr/)
  - [phenotype_association_type](https://osf.io/druqa/)
  - [site_type](https://osf.io/64dwq/)
  - [subject_ethnicity](https://osf.io/5gy7r/)
  - [subject_granularity](https://osf.io/gpf3d/)
  - [subject_race](https://osf.io/jp492/)
  - [subject_role](https://osf.io/fapnr/)
  - [subject_sex](https://osf.io/wepsz/)

## Submission Guide

_Sourced from the [CFDE C2M2 Documentation](https://github.com/MaayanLab/cfde-c2m2)_

### Step 1: Install CFDE C2M2 CLI

```bash
pipx install cfde-c2m2
```

### Step 2: Initialize Submission

Initializes a fresh C2M2 submission in the current working directory, creating blank versions of all tables defined in the current C2M2 datapackage schema (`C2M2_datapackage.json`).

```bash
mkdir submission
cd submission
cfde-c2m2 init
```

### Step 3: Fill in tables

Usually you would develop a script to format the information you already have into the structure of the C2M2 tables.
The schema is designed to support incremental improvements and as such many tables and fields are optional.
An example of doing this is available below in the tutorial.

### Step 4: Prepare submission

Resolves ontology identifiers and populates the Common Vocabulary (CV) tables.

```bash
cfde-c2m2 prepare
```

### Step 5: Validate

Checks validity of C2M2 submission and highlights tables for which corrections, if any, are needed.

```bash
cfde-c2m2 validate
```

### Step 6: Package

Collects metadata tables in a zip file to be submitted to the DRC portal.

```bash
cfde-c2m2 package
```

### Step 7: Submit

Currently, the CFDE Workbench Data Portal accepts complete datapackage submissions in ZIP file format (*.zip).

For specific instructions on using the submission system, see the [Contribution Guide](https://data.cfde.cloud/submit).

To submit a datapackage, navigate to the [Submission System](https://data.cfde.cloud/submit/form).

## Tutorial
For the April 2022 CFDE Cross-Pollination meeting, the LINCS DCC demonstrated a Jupyter Notebook tutorial on building the `file`, `biosample`, and `subject` tables for LINCS L1000 signature data. The code and files can be found at the following link:

[LINCS C2M2 Demo (04-05-2022 Cross-Pollination)](https://github.com/MaayanLab/lincs-data-manifests/tree/main/April-CrossPollination-Demo)

Code snippets from this tutorial corresponding to each step are reproduced below. Note that the C2M2 datapackage building process will vary across DCCs, depending on the types of generated data, ontologies, and access standards in place. In general, the process will be as follows:
1. Become familiar with the current structure of the C2M2, including the required fields across the entity and association tables, start with the steps from the submission guide:

    ```bash
    # install the cfde-c2m2 helper CLI
    pipx install cfde-c2m2

    # create a directory for the submission
    mkdir submission
    cd submission

    # initialize the submission directory, fetching the C2M2_datapackage.json and building blank tables
    cfde-c2m2 init
    ```

2. Identify the relevant namespace for all files, and build the `id_namespace` and `dcc` tables first.

    - For LINCS, the namespace "https://lincsproject.org" is used. The following code will generate the LINCS `id_namespace` table:
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    pd.DataFrame([{
      'id': 'https://www.lincsproject.org',
      'abbreviation': 'LINCS',
      'name': 'Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures',
      'description': 'A network-based understanding of biology',
    }], columns=['id', 'abbreviation', 'name', 'description']
    ).to_csv('id_namespace.tsv', sep='\t', index=False)
    ```

3. Identify all relevant projects and their associated files that will be included in the C2M2 datapackage. Generate container entity tables (`project`, `collection`) that describe logic, theme, or funding-based groups of the core entities. Note that projects and collections may be nested, in the `project_in_project` and `collection_in_collection` tables.

    - In the LINCS tutorial, the data comes from the 2021 release of the LINCS L1000 Connectivity Map dataset. In creating a project representing the files from this dataset, there must also be an overarching root project for all LINCS data.
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    from datetime import datetime
    pd.DataFrame([
      {
        'id_namespace': 'https://www.lincsproject.org',
        'local_id': 'LINCS',
        'persistent_id': 'https://www.lincsproject.org',
        'creation_time': datetime(2013, 1, 1).astimezone().isoformat(),
        'abbreviation': 'LINCS',
        'name': 'Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures',
        'description': 'A network-based understanding of biology',
      },
      {
        'id_namespace': 'https://www.lincsproject.org',
        'local_id': 'LINCS-2021',
        'persistent_id': 'https://clue.io/data/CMap2020#LINCS2020',
        'creation_time': datetime(2020, 11, 20).astimezone().isoformat(),
        'abbreviation': 'LINCS_2021',
        'name': 'LINCS 2021 Data Release',
        'description': 'The 2021 beta release of the CMap LINCS resource',
      }
    ], columns=[
      'id_namespace', 'local_id', 'persistent_id', 'creation_time',
      'abbreviation', 'name', 'description'
    ]).to_csv('project.tsv', sep='\t', index=False)

    pd.DataFrame([{
      'parent_project_id_namespace': 'https://www.lincsproject.org',
      'parent_project_local_id': 'LINCS',
      'child_project_id_namespace': 'https://www.lincsproject.org',
      'child_project_local_id': 'LINCS-2021',
    }], columns=[
      'parent_project_id_namespace', 'parent_project_local_id',
      'child_project_id_namespace', 'child_project_local_id'
    ]).to_csv('project_in_project.tsv', sep='\t', index=False)
    ```

4. Determine the relationships between files and their associated samples or biological subjects, as well as all relevant assay types, analysis methods, data types, file formats, etc. Also identify all appropriate ontological mappings, if any, corresponding to each value from above.

    - The LINCS DCC includes internal drug, gene, and cell line identifiers, which were mapped to PubChem, Ensembl, and Disease Ontology/UBERON manually ahead of time, but other DCCs may already make use of the CFDE-supported ontologies.
    - For instance, the LINCS signature `L1000_LINCS_DCIC_ABY001_A375_XH_A16_lapatinib_10uM.tsv.gz` comes from the biosample `ABY001_A375_XH_A16_lapatinib_10uM` (in this case an experimental condition) and the subject cell line `A375`; has a data type of expression matrix (`data:0928`); is stored as a TSV file format (`format:3475`) with GZIP compression format (`format:3989`); and has a MIME type of `text/tab-separated-values`.
    - The `ABY001_A375_XH_A16_lapatinib_10uM` biosample was obtained via the L1000 sequencing assay type (`OBI:0002965`); comes from a cell line derived from the skin (`UBERON:0002097`); and was treated with the compound lapatinib (`CID:208908`).

5. Either manually or programmatically, generate each data table, starting with the core entity tables (`file`, `biosample`, `subject`). This step will depend entirely on the format of a DCC's existing metadata and ontology mapping tables.

6. Generate the inter-entity linkage association tables (`file_describes_biosample`, `file_describes_subject`, `biosample_from_subject`).

    - In the LINCS tutorial, since the filenames come directly from the biosamples, once the `file` and `biosample` tables have both been built, `file_describes_biosample` can be generated.
    ```
    fdb = file_df[['id_namespace', 'local_id']].copy()
    fdb = fdb.rename(
      columns={
        'id_namespace': 'file_id_namespace',
        'local_id': 'file_local_id'
      }
    )
    fdb['biosample_id_namespace'] = fdb['file_id_namespace']
    fdb['biosample_local_id'] = fdb['file_local_id'].apply(file_2_biosample_map_function)
    ```

7. Assign files, biosamples, and subjects to any collections, if applicable, using the `file_in_collection`, `subject_in_collection`, and `biosample_in_collection` tables.

    - Collections are optional, and can represent files from the same publications or other logical groupings outside of funding.

8. Continue with submission guide:

    ```bash
    # finish preparing your package by resolving iris
    cfde-c2m2 prepare
    # verify integrity of your package and address any errors
    cfde-c2m2 validate
    # zip the necessary files for a bare minimum package
    cfde-c2m2 package
    ```

9. The `C2M2_datapackage.zip` file can now be uploaded to the [CFDE Workbench Metadata and Data Submission System](https://data.cfde.cloud/submit/form).

# CFDE Webinar Series

The CFDE Webinar Series brings the varied programs of the CFDE to the broad biomedical research community. Join us on the last Friday of each month at 1-2 PM ET to learn the science behind the research programs that comprise CFDE, as well as about the CFDE as a whole and its coordination Centers. Please visit [CFDE Knowledge Center](https://hugeamp.org/research.html?pageid=CFDE_webinars) for more details.

  <b>Metabolomics Workbench/National Metabolomics Data Repository</b>: the bridge to the missing "ome" in systems biology and medicine <i>Shankar Subramaniam and Mano Maurya, University of California San Diego</i>
</summary>
Metabolites are ubiquitous molecules in our body, functioning in myriad ways in normal and diseased states. In addition to serving as markers of our body function, they also are sentinel molecules present in body fluids like blood, saliva, and urine. Modern technologies have transformed our ability to measure tens of thousands of metabolites from physiology quantitatively. Analysis of the metabolome – the largesse of metabolites in physiology – has the potential to help us assess the state of the human or any living system. The Metabolomics Workbench, which houses the National Metabolomics Data Repository, serves as a unique one-stop resource for metabolomics and allows a user to easily navigate the landscape of metabolites and how they relate to other molecules like proteins and nucleic acids. We will provide a hitchhiker’s journey into the Metabolomics Workbench in this presentation.

The mission of the CFDE Knowledge Center (KC) is to curate, analyze, and integrate the results generated by CFDE programs. We will give an overview of the initial iteration of the KC Portal and demonstrate our analysis of Metabolomics Workbench data.
